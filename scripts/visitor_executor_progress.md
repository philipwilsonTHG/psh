# Visitor Executor Implementation Progress

## Summary
We've made significant progress implementing the visitor executor pattern for PSH. Starting from 302 failures with the visitor executor, we've reduced it to 66 failures.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Test Output Capture (Fixed)
- Modified ShellState to use properties for stdout/stderr that always return current sys.stdout/stderr
- This ensures pytest's capsys fixture works correctly with the visitor executor
- Reduced failures from 302 to ~80

### 2. Array Support (Fixed)
- Implemented visit_ArrayInitialization for array creation
- Implemented visit_ArrayElementAssignment for element assignment
- Added support for array append mode (+=)
- Fixed array expansion in for loops to properly handle "${arr[@]}"
- Fixed attribute access (using _elements instead of elements)

### 3. Break/Continue Statements (Partially Fixed)
- Fixed error messages to match expected format
- Fixed break/continue outside loops to properly stop execution
- Added exception propagation in StatementList
- Still need to fix: break/continue in functions called from loops

### 4. Shell Options (Fixed)
- Implemented xtrace (-x) option:
  - Prints commands before execution to stderr
  - Supports custom PS4 prompt
  - Handles both commands and variable assignments
- Implemented pipefail option:
  - Returns rightmost non-zero exit status from pipeline
  - Uses job manager's collect_all_statuses feature

### 5. For Loop Improvements (Fixed)
- Enhanced array expansion handling in for loops
- Added support for array expansions that produce multiple items
- Fixed glob expansion integration

## Remaining Issues (66 failures)

### 1. Command Substitution (~40 failures)
- Command substitution output not being captured properly
- Particularly problematic in arithmetic expressions
- Issue appears to be with forked process output capture

### 2. Redirections (~10 failures)  
- Tilde expansion not working in redirect targets
- Some builtin redirections not working properly
- Process substitution issues

### 3. Pipeline/Background Jobs (~10 failures)
- Some edge cases with pipeline execution
- Background job notifications

### 4. Miscellaneous (~6 failures)
- Break/continue in functions within loops
- Some integration test failures

## Test Results Comparison

| Executor | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Legacy   | 1163   | 5      | 99.6%     |
| Visitor  | 1102   | 66     | 94.3%     |

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Fix command substitution output capture
   - The core issue affecting ~40 tests
   - Likely requires changes to how forked processes handle stdout/stderr

2. **Priority 2**: Fix remaining redirection issues
   - Ensure expansions work in redirect targets
   - Fix builtin redirections

3. **Priority 3**: Complete break/continue support
   - Handle break/continue propagation through function calls

4. **Priority 4**: Fix remaining edge cases
   - Pipeline and background job issues
   - Integration test failures

## Code Quality Improvements Made

- Consistent error handling and reporting
- Proper use of context managers for redirections
- Clear separation of concerns in visitor methods
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy executor
