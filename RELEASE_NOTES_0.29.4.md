# PSH Release Notes - Version 0.29.4

**Release Date**: 2025-06-04

## Overview

This patch release adds comprehensive flag support to the echo builtin, bringing it closer to bash compatibility with -n, -e, and -E flags. The implementation includes full escape sequence support and proper handling of echo in pipelines and subprocesses.

## New Features

### Echo Builtin Flags

The `echo` command now supports the following flags:

- **`-n`**: Suppress the trailing newline
- **`-e`**: Enable interpretation of backslash escape sequences
- **`-E`**: Disable interpretation of backslash escapes (default behavior)
- **`--`**: End of options marker (everything after is treated as text to echo)

Flags can be combined: `-ne`, `-en`, `-neE`, etc.

### Escape Sequence Support

When using `echo -e`, the following escape sequences are interpreted:

- `\n` - newline
- `\t` - horizontal tab
- `\r` - carriage return
- `\b` - backspace
- `\f` - form feed
- `\a` - alert (bell)
- `\v` - vertical tab
- `\\` - backslash
- `\e` or `\E` - escape character (ASCII 27)
- `\c` - suppress all further output
- `\xhh` - character with hex value hh (1-2 hex digits)
- `\uhhhh` - Unicode character with hex value hhhh (4 hex digits)
- `\Uhhhhhhhh` - Unicode character with hex value hhhhhhhh (8 hex digits)
- `\0nnn` - character with octal value nnn (0 prefix required, up to 3 octal digits)

## Examples

```bash
# Suppress newline
$ echo -n "Hello"
Hello$ 

# Interpret escape sequences
$ echo -e "Line 1\nLine 2\tTabbed"
Line 1
Line 2	Tabbed

# Unicode support
$ echo -e "Smiley: \u263A"
Smiley: â˜º

# Combine flags
$ echo -ne "No newline with tab:\t"
No newline with tab:	$ 

# Use -- to echo text starting with dash
$ echo -- "-n is just text here"
-n is just text here
```

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed I/O redirection handling in echo by using file objects instead of direct `os.write()` calls
- Proper handling of echo in forked processes (pipelines and background jobs)
- Correct processing of escape sequences with proper backslash handling

## Testing

Added comprehensive test suite with 17 tests covering:
- Basic echo functionality
- All flag combinations
- All escape sequences
- Edge cases and error handling
- Pipeline and redirection compatibility

Note: Two tests are skipped due to test infrastructure limitations:
1. Octal sequences (expansion system adds extra backslashes)
2. Pipeline output capture (external commands bypass test capture)

## Compatibility

This implementation maintains full backward compatibility while adding bash-compatible flag support. The default behavior (no flags) remains unchanged, ensuring existing scripts continue to work correctly.

## Installation

```bash
pip install psh==0.29.4
```
