# Array Implementation Progress

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed History Expansion Bug
- **Issue**: History expansion was hanging when `!` was followed by a space (e.g., in `[[ ! "a" = "b" ]]`)
- **Root Cause**: When `!` didn't match any history pattern, the loop counter `i` was never incremented, causing an infinite loop
- **Fix**: Added proper handling to treat `!` as a regular character when it doesn't match any history expansion pattern
- **Impact**: Fixed the hanging `test_negation` test in enhanced test operators

### 2. Fixed Integer Attribute Arithmetic
- **Issue**: `declare -i` variables weren't evaluating arithmetic expressions (e.g., `declare -i calc='X / Y'` was setting calc to 0)
- **Root Cause**: The scope manager was only doing simple integer conversion, not full arithmetic evaluation
- **Fix**: 
  - Added shell reference to EnhancedScopeManager for accessing arithmetic evaluator
  - Updated `_evaluate_integer` to use the shell's `evaluate_arithmetic` function
  - This properly evaluates expressions with variables, operators, and parentheses
- **Impact**: Fixed `test_declare_integer_arithmetic_operations`

## Test Results

### Before:
- 12 failing tests out of 962 (98.8% passing)
- `test_negation` was hanging
- Array tests: 25/28 passing (89%)

### After (History & Integer fixes):
- 11 failing tests out of 962 (98.9% passing)
- All tests run without hanging
- Array tests: 26/28 passing (93%)

### After += Implementation:
- 9 failing tests out of 962 (99.1% passing)
- Array tests: 28/28 passing (100%)
- All array functionality complete

### After Declare & Regex Fixes:
- 5 failing tests out of 962 (99.5% passing)
- Fixed `declare -a arr=(...)` syntax parsing
- Fixed regex matching with `=~` operator in `[[ ]]`

## += Operator Implementation

### Summary
Implemented the `+=` operator for:
1. **Regular variables**: `x+="append"` - appends to existing variable value
2. **Array initialization**: `arr+=(new elements)` - appends new elements to array
3. **Array elements**: `arr[0]+="more text"` - appends to specific array element

### Implementation Details:
- Updated `_is_variable_assignment` and `_handle_pure_assignments` in command executor
- Modified parser to recognize `+=` in array syntax (`_is_array_assignment`, `_parse_array_element_assignment`, `_parse_array_initialization`)
- Added `is_append` flag to `ArrayInitialization` and `ArrayElementAssignment` AST nodes
- Updated array handling in executor to support append operations

## Additional Fixes

### 3. Fixed Declare Array Initialization
- **Issue**: `declare -a arr=(one two three)` was causing parse errors
- **Root Cause**: Parser was tokenizing `arr=(` as separate tokens instead of treating the whole expression as an argument
- **Fix**: Added special case in parser to recognize `word=(...) ` patterns and parse them as complete arguments
- **Impact**: Fixed all three declare array tests

### 4. Fixed Regex Matching in Enhanced Test
- **Issue**: `[[ "test123" =~ [0-9]+ ]]` was causing parse errors
- **Root Cause**: Tokenizer was treating `[` and `]` in regex patterns as bracket operators
- **Fix**: Added context tracking for regex patterns after `=~` operator to treat brackets as literal characters
- **Impact**: Fixed regex matching in enhanced test operators

## Remaining Work

### Failing Tests (5 remaining)
- 2 glob concatenation tests (word concatenation with globs)
- 1 parameter expansion case modification test  
- 1 case statement character class test
- 1 debug scopes output format test

## Technical Notes

### History Expansion Fix
The fix ensures that when `!` is encountered but doesn't match any history expansion pattern (!!,  !n, !-n, !string, !?string?), it's treated as a regular character. This is crucial for shell constructs like the enhanced test negation operator.

### Integer Arithmetic Integration
The enhanced scope manager now properly integrates with the shell's arithmetic evaluator, enabling full bash-compatible arithmetic expressions in integer variable assignments. This required:
1. Adding a shell reference to the scope manager
2. Using the `evaluate_arithmetic` helper function that handles tokenization, parsing, and evaluation
3. Proper error handling to return 0 on evaluation failure (bash behavior)
