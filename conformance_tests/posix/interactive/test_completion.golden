Testing completion functionality:
Testing file completion concepts:
Files available for completion:
command_example
command_test
dir1
dir2
directory_test
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.log
Testing directory completion concepts:
Directories available for completion:
dir1/
dir2/
directory_test/
Testing command completion concepts:
Commands available for completion:
command_example
command_test
Testing variable completion concepts:
Variables available for completion:
Testing completion contexts:
Context: filename after command
Example: cat <TAB> would show:
file1.txt
file2.txt
Context: directory with cd
Example: cd <TAB> would show:
dir1/
dir2/
directory_test/
Context: variable completion
Example: echo $TEST_<TAB> would complete to:
Testing partial match completion:
Files starting with 'file':
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.log
Directories starting with 'dir':
dir1/
dir2/
directory_test/
Commands starting with 'command':
command_example
command_test
Testing completion edge cases:
Empty directory completion:
No matches case:
No matches found
Single match case:
unique_file.txt
Common prefix matches:
prefix_file1.txt
prefix_file2.txt
Testing special characters in completion:
Files with special characters:
file with spaces.txt
file_with_underscores.txt
file-with-dashes.txt
Testing hidden file completion:
Hidden files:
.hidden_file1
.hidden_file2
Testing case sensitivity:
Case variations:
file with spaces.txt
file_with_underscores.txt
file-with-dashes.txt
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.log
Testing subdirectory completion:
Files in dir1/:
nested_file.txt
Files in dir2/:
another_file.log
Testing completion with glob patterns:
Text files:
file with spaces.txt
file_with_underscores.txt
file-with-dashes.txt
file1.txt
file2.txt
prefix_file1.txt
prefix_file2.txt
unique_file.txt
Log files:
file3.log
Testing completion performance concepts:
Large directory completion test:
Files created:       20
Testing completion from parent directory:
completion_test contents:
command_example
command_test
dir1
dir2
directory_test
Completion test completed
