# Test history expansion functionality
# PSH supports bash-compatible history expansion (v0.33.0 feature)

# Note: History expansion testing is limited in script mode
# This test focuses on the expansion mechanisms that can be tested

# Test basic history expansion patterns (simulated)
echo "Testing history expansion patterns:"

# Set up some command history simulation
echo "Setting up history context..."
true  # command 1
echo "test command"  # command 2
false # command 3

# Test !! pattern (would expand to previous command)
echo "Testing !! expansion:"
echo "Previous command would be: !!"

# Test !n pattern (would expand to command n)
echo "Testing !n expansion:"
echo "Command 1 would be: !1"
echo "Command 2 would be: !2"

# Test !-n pattern (would expand to command n back)
echo "Testing !-n expansion:"
echo "Last command would be: !-1"
echo "Two commands back would be: !-2"

# Test !string pattern (would expand to last command starting with string)
echo "Testing !string expansion:"
echo "Last echo would be: !echo"
echo "Last true would be: !true"

# Test !?string? pattern (would expand to last command containing string)
echo "Testing !?string? expansion:"
echo "Command containing 'test': !?test?"
echo "Command containing 'command': !?command?"

# Test history expansion in different contexts
echo "Testing history expansion contexts:"

# In variable assignment
echo "In variable assignment:"

# Test history expansion with special characters

# Test history expansion errors (should be handled gracefully)

# Test history substitution modifiers (advanced)

# Test history expansion with glob patterns

# Test rapid fire pattern (common use case)

# Test history expansion in loops

# Test history with redirections
