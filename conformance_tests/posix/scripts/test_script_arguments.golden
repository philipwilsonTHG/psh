Testing script argument handling:
Script name: psh
Total arguments: 0
All arguments:
All arguments (quoted):
First argument:
Second argument:
Third argument:
Fourth argument:
Fifth argument:
Tenth argument:
Fifteenth argument:
Testing $@ vs $*:
Using $*: arg with spaces another arg third
Using $@: arg with spaces another arg third
Iterating over arguments with $@:
  Arg: [arg]
  Arg: [with]
  Arg: [spaces]
  Arg: [another]
  Arg: [arg]
  Arg: [third]
Iterating over arguments with $*:
  Word: [arg]
  Word: [with]
  Word: [spaces]
  Word: [another]
  Word: [arg]
  Word: [third]
Testing with simple arguments:

Testing with spaces and special characters:

Testing with many arguments:
Testing $0 variations:
Script $0: psh
Basename: psh
Dirname: .
Direct execution:
Relative path execution:
Absolute path execution:
Testing shift builtin:
Before shift: $# = 3, $1 = arg with spaces, $2 = another arg, $3 = third
After shift 1: $# = 2, $1 = another arg, $2 = third, $3 =
After shift 2: $# = 0, $1 = , $2 = , $3 =
Testing set builtin:
Original args:
After set: new_arg1 new_arg2 new_arg3
Arg count: 3
First: new_arg1, Second: new_arg2, Third: new_arg3
After set --: 0 arguments
Testing argument validation:
Error: At least 2 arguments required
