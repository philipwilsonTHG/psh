# PSH v0.49.0 Release Notes - Visitor Pattern Phase 4

## Overview

This release completes Phase 4 of the visitor pattern implementation, providing a full migration path from the legacy executor to the modern visitor-based executor. The visitor executor offers cleaner architecture, better maintainability, and enables advanced AST analysis features.

## New Features

### Multiple Ways to Enable Visitor Executor

1. **Environment Variable** (Recommended for testing):
   ```bash
   export PSH_USE_VISITOR_EXECUTOR=1
   psh
   ```

2. **Command Line Flag**:
   ```bash
   psh --visitor-executor
   ```

3. **Shell Option** (Can be toggled at runtime):
   ```bash
   psh
   $ set -o visitor-executor    # Enable
   $ set +o visitor-executor   # Disable
   ```

4. **RC File Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Add to ~/.pshrc
   set -o visitor-executor
   ```

### Advanced AST Visitors

The visitor pattern enables powerful AST analysis and transformation:

1. **OptimizationVisitor**: Automatically optimizes shell scripts
   - Removes unnecessary `cat` commands from pipelines
   - Eliminates dead code (unreachable statements)
   - Simplifies redundant constructs

2. **SecurityVisitor**: Detects potential security vulnerabilities
   - Command injection risks (eval with user input)
   - World-writable file permissions (chmod 777)
   - Unquoted variable expansions that could cause issues
   - Downloads piped to shell execution

3. **MetricsVisitor**: Analyzes code complexity
   - Cyclomatic complexity calculation
   - Command frequency analysis
   - Function and loop counting
   - Variable usage tracking

### Visitor Pipeline System

Compose multiple visitors for complex analysis:

```python
from psh.visitor.visitor_pipeline import VisitorPipeline, get_global_registry

pipeline = VisitorPipeline(get_global_registry())
pipeline.add_visitor('metrics')
pipeline.add_visitor('security')
pipeline.add_visitor('optimizer')

results = pipeline.run(ast)
```

## Migration Tools

### For Users

- **migrate_to_visitor.sh**: Automated migration script
  - Updates ~/.pshrc to enable visitor executor
  - Tests that visitor executor works correctly
  - Provides rollback instructions

### For Developers

- **scripts/test_visitor_executor.py**: Comprehensive test runner
  - Runs full test suite with both executors
  - Identifies tests that behave differently
  - Generates detailed comparison report

- **scripts/migrate_visitor_executor.py**: Codebase migration helper
  - Updates shell initialization
  - Adds compatibility layers
  - Creates test infrastructure

## Performance

The visitor executor performance is within 14% of the legacy executor, meeting our goal of staying within 15%. Further optimizations are possible but not critical for most use cases.

## Documentation

- **docs/visitor_executor_migration.md**: Complete migration guide
  - Phased migration plan
  - Risk mitigation strategies
  - Success metrics
  - Rollback procedures

- **examples/visitor_pipeline_demo.py**: Demonstrates visitor composition
  - Shows how to analyze and optimize scripts
  - Examples of security scanning
  - Code metrics extraction

## Backward Compatibility

The legacy executor remains the default to ensure stability. Users can opt-in to the visitor executor when ready. All existing scripts and features work identically with both executors.

## Testing

- All 1131 tests pass with the legacy executor
- Visitor executor compatibility verified through comprehensive test suite
- New compatibility tests ensure identical behavior between executors

## Next Steps

1. Enable visitor executor in your environment for testing
2. Report any issues or behavioral differences
3. Gradual rollout planned over next 3-6 months
4. Legacy executor deprecation after successful migration
