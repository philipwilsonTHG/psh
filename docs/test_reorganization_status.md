# Test Reorganization Status

## Summary

I've created the foundational infrastructure for reorganizing PSH's test suite from 1800+ ad-hoc tests into a well-structured, maintainable framework. The new framework supports parallel execution with the existing tests during migration.

## What's Been Created

### 1. Test Reorganization Plan
- **Location**: `docs/test_reorganization_plan.md`
- **Content**: Comprehensive 12-week plan covering all aspects of test migration
- **Phases**: Infrastructure → Analysis → Core Components → Interactive → Conformance → Performance → QA

### 2. New Test Directory Structure

### 3. Test Framework Classes

#### Base Framework (`tests_new/framework/base.py`)
- `PSHTestCase`: Base class with common utilities
- `CommandResult`: Structured test result handling
- Helper methods for file/directory creation, assertions, environment management

#### Interactive Framework (`tests_new/framework/interactive.py`)
- `InteractivePSHTest`: Base class using pexpect for terminal testing
- Methods for sending keys, control characters, testing line editing
- `InteractiveTestHelpers`: Common patterns for history, completion, etc.

#### Conformance Framework (`tests_new/framework/conformance.py`)
- `ConformanceTest`: Compare PSH and bash behavior
- `ComparisonResult`: Track differences and document expected variations
- Support for POSIX compliance testing

### 4. Example Test Files

- **Unit Test**: `tests_new/unit/lexer/test_basic_tokenization.py`
  - Shows pure unit testing of lexer functionality
  - Tests need updating to match current PSH behavior

- **Interactive Test**: `tests_new/system/interactive/test_line_editing.py`
  - Demonstrates pexpect-based terminal interaction testing
  - Tests cursor movement, history, multiline editing, signals

- **Conformance Test**: `tests_new/conformance/bash/test_basic_commands.py`

  - Tests for identical behavior and documented differences

- **Performance Test**: `tests_new/performance/benchmarks/test_parsing_performance.py`
  - Benchmarks parsing speed and memory usage
  - Sets performance baselines and checks for regressions

### 5. Supporting Tools

#### Test Analysis Script (`tools/analyze_tests.py`)
- Analyzes test files to understand coverage and organization
- Identifies components being tested
- Detects gaps and duplications
- Generates JSON reports for tracking

#### Test Migration Runner (`tools/run_test_migration.py`)
- Runs both old and new test suites
- Compares results and tracks migration progress
- Generates migration status reports
- Shows which components have been migrated

### 6. CI/CD Integration

- **Updated pytest.ini**: Configured to run both test suites
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: `.github/workflows/test_migration.yml`

   - Error propagation through complex command chains
   - Memory cleanup in long-running operations

2. **Advanced Performance Testing** (Phase 6 from plan):
   - Memory usage benchmarks (`tests_new/performance/memory/`)
   - Stress testing (`tests_new/performance/stress/`)
   - Large input handling

3. **Comprehensive Error Path Testing**:

## Migration Strategy

The migration can proceed incrementally:
1. New features get tests in the new structure
2. When fixing bugs, migrate related tests
3. Dedicate time to migrate one component at a time
4. Run both test suites until migration complete
5. Gradually phase out old tests as coverage improves
