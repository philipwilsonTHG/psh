# Shell Refactoring Phase 3 Status

## Summary
Phase 3 of the shell.py refactoring has been successfully completed. The I/O redirection system has been extracted into dedicated components while maintaining full backward compatibility. All tests (585) continue to pass.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. IOManager Created ✓
- Created `io_redirect/manager.py` as the central orchestrator
- Manages all I/O redirection types
- Provides clean context manager for temporary redirections
- Integrates sub-handlers for different redirection types

### 2. File Redirection Extracted ✓
- Created `io_redirect/file_redirect.py` with FileRedirector class
- Handles all file-based redirections:
  - Input redirection (<)
  - Output redirection (>, >>)
  - FD duplication (2>&1)
  - Proper file descriptor management

### 3. Heredoc Handling Extracted ✓
- Created `io_redirect/heredoc.py` with HeredocHandler class
- Recursive heredoc collection for all AST node types
- Supports both << and <<- (tab stripping)
- Variable expansion in unquoted heredocs
- Fixed case statement handling bug

### 4. Process Substitution Extracted ✓
- Created `io_redirect/process_sub.py` with ProcessSubstitutionHandler class
- Handles both <(...) and >(...) forms
- Proper pipe and process management
- Clean resource cleanup

### 5. Shell Integration ✓
- Added IOManager to Shell class
- Updated all I/O methods to delegate to manager
- Removed old method bodies (kept as delegation stubs)
- Maintained full backward compatibility

## Architecture Changes

### Before:
```
shell.py (2700+ lines)
├── _apply_redirections()
├── _restore_redirections()
├── _setup_builtin_redirections()
├── _restore_builtin_redirections()
├── _setup_child_redirections()
├── _collect_heredocs()
├── _setup_process_substitutions()
└── _cleanup_process_substitutions()
```

### After:
```
shell.py (cleaner)
├── io_manager = IOManager(self)
├── _apply_redirections() → delegates to manager
├── _restore_redirections() → delegates to manager
├── _collect_heredocs() → delegates to manager
├── _setup_process_substitutions() → delegates to manager
└── _cleanup_process_substitutions() → delegates to manager

io_redirect/
├── manager.py (IOManager - orchestrator)
├── file_redirect.py (FileRedirector)
├── heredoc.py (HeredocHandler)
└── process_sub.py (ProcessSubstitutionHandler)
```

## Test Results
```
================== 585 passed, 22 skipped, 2 xfailed in 3.56s ==================
```

## Lines of Code Impact
- Removed ~400 lines from shell.py
- Added ~650 lines across I/O modules
- Net increase due to:
  - Proper class structure
  - Better separation of concerns
  - Enhanced documentation
  - Future extensibility

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed case statement heredoc collection issue where `item.commands` was incorrectly treated as iterable

## Next Steps

Phase 3 is complete and ready for Phase 4: Executor Components. This will be the most complex phase as it involves extracting command execution logic.

### Phase 4 Preview
1. Create CommandExecutor for single command execution
2. Create PipelineExecutor for pipeline management
3. Create ControlFlowExecutor for control structures
4. Extract process management to executor/process.py
5. Update shell.py to use executor components

## Notes
- Some builtin redirection methods (_setup_builtin_redirections, _restore_builtin_redirections, _setup_child_redirections) were not fully extracted as they have complex dependencies
- Process substitution now has cleaner separation with dedicated handler
- All functionality preserved with no breaking changes
- Clean separation of concerns achieved for I/O subsystem
