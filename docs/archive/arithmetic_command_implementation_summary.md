# Arithmetic Command Syntax Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented arithmetic command syntax `((expression))` in psh, enabling standalone arithmetic evaluation with proper exit status handling. This feature was needed for full bash compatibility and enabled 5 previously failing C-style for loop tests.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. AST Node
- Added `ArithmeticCommand` class in `ast_nodes.py`
- Extends `Statement` to work in all statement contexts
- Stores arithmetic expression and optional redirects

### 2. Tokenization
- Added `DOUBLE_LPAREN` token type for `((`
- Updated state machine lexer to recognize `((` as a distinct token

### 3. Parser Support
- Added arithmetic command parsing in control structure contexts
- Updated `parse_statement()` and `_parse_control_structure()` 
- Created `parse_arithmetic_command()` method
- Enhanced C-style for loop parser to handle both `((` token and DOUBLE_LPAREN
- Fixed issue with `;;` being tokenized as DOUBLE_SEMICOLON in empty for loops

### 4. Executor
- Created `ArithmeticCommandExecutor` in `executor/arithmetic_command.py`
- Leverages existing arithmetic evaluation infrastructure
- Returns proper exit codes: 0 for non-zero results, 1 for zero results
- Integrated into `ExecutorManager` and statement execution flow

### 5. Exit Status Handling
- Fixed critical bug where `last_exit_code` wasn't updated between TopLevel items
- Ensured arithmetic commands update `$?` immediately for subsequent commands

## Test Results

### C-style For Loop Tests
All 19 tests now pass, including the 5 that were previously marked as xfail:
- `test_empty_condition` - infinite loops with break using `if ((condition))`
- `test_empty_update` - manual increment with `((i++))`
- `test_all_empty` - fully manual loop control
- `test_break_in_c_style_for` - conditional break with `if ((i == 5))`
- `test_continue_in_c_style_for` - conditional continue

### New Arithmetic Command Tests
Added comprehensive test suite with 10 tests covering:
- Basic evaluation and exit status
- Variable assignments and modifications
- Compound assignments (+=, -=, *=, etc.)
- Increment/decrement operators
- Use in if/while conditions
- Multiple expressions with comma operator
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (&&, ||)
- Ternary operator
- Error handling

### Overall Test Suite Impact
- Total tests increased from 729 to 739 (10 new tests)
- xfailed tests reduced from 8 to 3 (5 fixed)
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic arithmetic command
((x = 5))
echo $x  # outputs: 5

# Exit status behavior
((0))
echo $?  # outputs: 1 (zero result returns exit code 1)

((5 > 3))
echo $?  # outputs: 0 (non-zero result returns exit code 0)

# In conditionals
if ((x > 3)); then
    echo "x is greater than 3"
fi

# In loops
i=0
while ((i < 10)); do
    echo $i
    ((i++))
done

# Multiple expressions
((a=1, b=2, c=a+b))
echo "$a $b $c"  # outputs: 1 2 3

# Complex expressions
((result = x > 5 ? x * 2 : x + 10))
```

## Limitations

1. **Pipeline Integration**: Arithmetic commands cannot be used directly in pipelines
   - `((x > 5)) && echo "yes"` doesn't work
   - Workaround: Use in if statements or with semicolons

2. **AndOrList Support**: Not integrated with && and || operators at the command level
   - This is consistent with how other statement types (if, while, etc.) work

## Implementation Quality

- Clean separation of concerns across components
- Reuses existing arithmetic evaluation infrastructure
- Minimal code duplication
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full test coverage
- Educational clarity maintained throughout

## Files Modified

1. `psh/ast_nodes.py` - Added ArithmeticCommand node
2. `psh/token_types.py` - Added DOUBLE_LPAREN token
3. `psh/state_machine_lexer.py` - Added `((` operator recognition
4. `psh/parser.py` - Added arithmetic command parsing
5. `psh/executor/arithmetic_command.py` - New executor component
6. `psh/executor/base.py` - Integrated arithmetic executor
7. `psh/executor/statement.py` - Added execution support and fixed exit code handling
8. `tests/test_c_style_for_loops.py` - Removed xfail decorators
9. `tests/test_arithmetic_command.py` - New comprehensive test suite

## Next Steps

The successful implementation of arithmetic command syntax opens the door for:
1. Better integration with pipelines (future enhancement)
2. Use in more complex shell constructs
3. Full bash script compatibility

This feature significantly improves psh's bash compatibility and enables more sophisticated shell scripting patterns.
