# Builtin Refactoring - Phase 1 Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the infrastructure for the new builtin system and migrated 7 core builtins as a proof of concept.

## What Was Done

### 1. Infrastructure Created
- `psh/builtins/` package structure
- `base.py` - Abstract base class for all builtins
- `registry.py` - Registry system with decorator pattern
- `__init__.py` - Package initialization

### 2. Builtins Migrated
- **Core builtins** (`core.py`):
  - `exit` - Exit the shell
  - `:` - Null command  
  - `true` - Always return success
  - `false` - Always return failure
  
- **I/O builtins** (`io.py`):
  - `echo` - Echo arguments to stdout
  - `pwd` - Print working directory
  
- **Navigation builtins** (`navigation.py`):
  - `cd` - Change directory

### 3. Shell Integration
- Modified `Shell.__init__` to use builtin registry
- Updated `_execute_builtin()` to check registry first
- Updated `execute_command()` to check both systems
- Updated `_execute_in_child()` for subprocess execution
- Added stdout/stderr/stdin attributes for compatibility

### 4. Testing
- All existing builtin tests pass
- Created comprehensive test suite for new system
- Identified known issue with builtin output in pipelines

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clean Architecture**: Each builtin is now a self-contained class
2. **Easy Registration**: Simple `@builtin` decorator
3. **Help System**: Each builtin has integrated help text
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout
5. **Testability**: Builtins can be tested in isolation

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Migrate Remaining Builtins
Priority order for migration:
1. Simple state readers: `env`, `history`, `version`
2. Variable management: `export`, `set`, `unset`
3. Aliases: `alias`, `unalias`
4. Functions: `declare`, `source`, `return`
5. Job control: `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`
6. Complex: `test`/`[`

### Phase 3: Enhancements
1. Add help builtin that lists all builtins
2. Improve error messages with builtin name prefix
3. Add builtin command to show builtin info
4. Consider builtin versioning for compatibility

## Code Statistics
- Lines added: ~400 (new builtin system)
- Lines to be removed: ~800 (old builtin methods)
- Net reduction: ~400 lines
- Improved organization: 7 files vs 1 monolithic file

## Known Issues
1. Builtin output in pipelines needs work (same as old system)
2. Exit builtin calls sys.exit() - may need refactoring for testability

The refactoring is off to a successful start with a solid foundation for migrating the remaining 15 builtins.
