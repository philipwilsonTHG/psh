# Recursion Depth Analysis for psh

## The Problem

You're right - Python's default recursion limit is 1000, and factorial(5) should only need 5 recursive calls. The fact that we're hitting the limit indicates a serious inefficiency in psh's implementation.

## Root Cause

The issue is that each level of shell function recursion in psh creates a multiplicative effect on Python's call stack depth. Here's why:

### 1. Command Substitution Overhead
Each `$(...)` command substitution:
- Creates a new Shell instance (subshell)
- Tokenizes the command
- Parses it into an AST
- Executes through multiple layers of managers
- Each step adds multiple Python function calls to the stack

### 2. Arithmetic Expansion Overhead
Each `$((...))` arithmetic expansion:
- Has its own tokenizer (ArithmeticTokenizer)
- Has its own parser (ArithmeticParser)
- Has its own evaluator (ArithmeticEvaluator)
- May trigger variable expansions
- Each operation is a recursive function call

### 3. Compound Effect
When you combine them in a recursive function:
```bash
factorial() {
    local n=$1
    if [ "$n" -le 1 ]; then
        echo 1
        return
    fi
    local result=$(factorial $((n - 1)))  # Two levels of expansion!
    echo $((n * result))
}
```

Each recursive call involves:
1. Function call overhead (multiple Python frames)
2. Command substitution overhead (dozens of frames)
3. Arithmetic expansion overhead (more frames)
4. Variable expansion overhead (additional frames)

## Actual Stack Depth

For a simple `factorial(2)`:
- Expected: ~2 recursive calls
- Actual: Likely 50-100+ Python function calls per shell recursion level

For `factorial(5)`:
- Expected: ~5 recursive calls
- Actual: Possibly 250-500+ Python function calls, approaching or exceeding 1000

## Why This Happens

The psh architecture prioritizes:
1. **Educational clarity** - Each component is separate and well-defined
2. **Clean separation** - Tokenizer → Parser → AST → Execution
3. **Modularity** - Each manager handles its specific concern

But this creates deep call stacks because each abstraction layer adds function calls.

## Comparison with Bash

Bash likely:
- Uses iterative algorithms where possible
- Has optimized C code with minimal function call overhead
- May flatten or optimize common patterns
- Doesn't create full subshell processes for simple command substitutions

## Solutions

1. **Short term (for users)**:
   - Use iterative algorithms
   - Avoid deep nesting of command substitution
   - Pre-calculate values to reduce nesting

2. **Long term (for psh development)**:
   - Optimize command substitution to reuse parser state
   - Consider tail-call optimization patterns
   - Cache parsed ASTs for repeated expansions
   - Reduce function call depth in critical paths
   - Special-case simple patterns (like variable expansion)

## Verification

The simple test that proved this:
```python
# Direct recursion works fine with recursion limit of 50
factorial_simple() {
    local n=$1
    if [ "$n" -le 1 ]; then
        echo 1
        return
    fi
    local result=$(factorial_simple 1)  # Just one level, no arithmetic
    echo $result
}
# This works!

# But add arithmetic:
factorial_arith() {
    local n=$1
    if [ "$n" -le 1 ]; then
        echo 1
        return
    fi
    local result=$(factorial_arith $((n - 1)))  # Now it fails quickly
    echo $((n * result))
}
# This fails with recursion error even for factorial(2)!
```

## Conclusion

You were absolutely right to question this. A recursion depth of 1000 should handle factorial(5) with room to spare. The fact that it doesn't reveals that psh's implementation creates excessive Python call stack depth - likely 50-100x more than necessary for recursive shell functions. This is an architectural issue rather than a bug in the local variable implementation.
