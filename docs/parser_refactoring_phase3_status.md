# Parser Refactoring Phase 3 Status

## Phase 3.1: Create Unified Types (COMPLETED)

### What Was Done

1. **Added ExecutionContext Enum**
   - `STATEMENT`: Execute in current shell process
   - `PIPELINE`: Execute in subshell for pipeline

2. **Created UnifiedControlStructure Base Class**
   - Inherits from both `Statement` and `CompoundCommand`
   - Enables types to function in both contexts

3. **Implemented Unified Types**
   - `WhileLoop`: Unified while loop
   - `ForLoop`: Unified for loop  
   - `CStyleForLoop`: Unified C-style for loop
   - `IfConditional`: Unified if/then/else
   - `CaseConditional`: Unified case statement
   - `SelectLoop`: Unified select statement
   - `ArithmeticEvaluation`: Unified arithmetic command

4. **Key Design Decisions**
   - Used multiple inheritance (Statement + CompoundCommand)
   - Added `execution_context` field to track usage
   - Included all fields needed by both contexts
   - Avoided dataclass field ordering issues

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Type Safety**: Single type can be used in both contexts
2. **Clear Intent**: execution_context field makes usage explicit
3. **Future Ready**: Foundation for eliminating duplicate parsing logic
4. **Backward Compatible**: Old types still work

### Proof of Concept

Created and tested a demonstration showing:
- Unified types inherit from both base classes
- Execution context can be set at creation time
- Executors can check context to determine behavior
- Import system works correctly

## Phase 3.2: Update Parser (COMPLETED)

### What Was Done

1. **Added Feature Flag**
   - `_use_unified_types` flag in Parser class
   - Allows gradual migration without breaking changes
   - Can be enabled via `parse()` function parameter

2. **Updated Parsing Methods**
   - Modified `parse_while_statement()` and `parse_while_command()`
   - Modified `parse_for_statement()` and `parse_for_command()`
   - Added unified helper methods:
     - `_parse_while_unified()`
     - `_parse_for_unified()`
     - `_parse_c_style_for_unified()`

3. **Execution Context Setting**
   - Statement parsing sets `ExecutionContext.STATEMENT`
   - Pipeline component parsing sets `ExecutionContext.PIPELINE`
   - Context determines execution strategy

4. **Comprehensive Tests**
   - Created `test_unified_parser.py` with 6 tests
   - Tests cover both statement and pipeline modes
   - Verifies backward compatibility
   - Confirms inheritance hierarchy

### Implementation Details

The parser now supports both modes:
```python
# Old behavior (default)
ast = parse(tokens)  # Creates WhileStatement/WhileCommand

# New unified behavior
ast = parse(tokens, use_unified_types=True)  # Creates WhileLoop
```

When unified types are enabled:
- Control structures parsed as statements get `ExecutionContext.STATEMENT`
- Control structures parsed in pipelines get `ExecutionContext.PIPELINE`
- Same AST node type used in both contexts

## Phase 3.3: Update Executors (COMPLETED)

### What Was Done

1. **Updated ControlFlowExecutor**
   - Added imports for unified types and ExecutionContext
   - Modified execute() to check unified types first
   - Validates execution context (raises error if PIPELINE context)
   - Falls back to old types for backward compatibility
   - Updated method signatures to accept both type variants

2. **Updated PipelineExecutor**
   - Added imports for unified types and ExecutionContext
   - Modified _execute_compound_in_subshell() to handle unified types
   - Validates execution context (raises error if STATEMENT context)
   - Routes to appropriate execution methods based on type
   - Updated method signatures for flexibility

3. **Updated StatementExecutor**
   - Added support for unified types in execute_toplevel()
   - Routes unified types to control flow executor
   - Maintains support for old types

4. **Fixed ForLoop Compatibility**
   - Updated execute_for() to handle both 'iterable' and 'items' attributes
   - Ensures both ForStatement and ForLoop work correctly

5. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Created test_unified_executor.py (4 tests)
   - Created test_unified_integration.py (5 tests)
   - All 15 unified tests pass
   - All existing tests continue to pass

### Implementation Details

Executors now check execution context:
```python
# ControlFlowExecutor
if isinstance(node, WhileLoop):
    if node.execution_context == ExecutionContext.STATEMENT:
        return self.execute_while(node)
    else:
        raise ValueError("WhileLoop with PIPELINE context in ControlFlowExecutor")

# PipelineExecutor
if isinstance(command, WhileLoop):
    if command.execution_context == ExecutionContext.PIPELINE:
        return self._execute_while_command(command)
    else:
        raise ValueError("WhileLoop with STATEMENT context in pipeline")
```

## Phase 3.4: Migrate Tests (COMPLETED)

### What Was Done

1. **Extended Parser Support**
   - Added unified parsing methods for all control structures:
     - `_parse_if_unified()` for if statements
     - `_parse_case_unified()` for case statements
     - `_parse_select_unified()` for select statements
     - `_parse_arithmetic_unified()` for arithmetic commands
   - Updated all parsing methods to use unified types when flag is set

2. **Created Test Infrastructure**
   - Created `test_control_structures_unified.py` with 16 parametrized tests
   - Tests verify both legacy and unified type parsing
   - Tests verify execution context is correctly set
   - Tests verify pipeline vs statement context handling

3. **Created Migration Helpers**
   - Created `unified_types_helper.py` with helper functions
   - Created `test_migration_guide.md` documenting migration process
   - Created `conftest_unified.py` for pytest configuration

4. **Demonstrated Migration Pattern**
   - Created `test_while_loops_migrated.py` as example migration
   - Shows how to support both type systems in tests
   - Uses parametrized tests for comprehensive coverage

### Test Results

All 16 unified type tests pass:
- While loops: statement and pipeline contexts âœ…
- For loops: statement and pipeline contexts âœ…
- C-style for loops: statement and pipeline contexts âœ…
- If statements: statement and pipeline contexts âœ…
- Case statements: statement and pipeline contexts âœ…
- Select statements: statement and pipeline contexts âœ…
- Arithmetic commands: statement and pipeline contexts âœ…
- Pipeline context validation âœ…
- Execution compatibility âœ…

## Next Steps

## Phase 3.5: Deprecate Old Types (IN PROGRESS)

### What Was Done

1. **Created Deprecation Infrastructure**
   - Created `deprecation.py` module with `deprecated_class` decorator
   - Adds runtime warnings when deprecated classes are instantiated
   - Updates class docstrings with deprecation notices
   - Tracks replacement class information

2. **Applied Deprecation Warnings**
   - All old dual types marked as deprecated (version 0.38.0)
   - Planned removal in version 0.40.0
   - Clear migration path to unified types provided
   - Warnings show: old type â†’ new type mapping

3. **Migrated Test Imports**
   - Created `migrate_test_imports.py` script to automate migration
   - Wrapped deprecated imports with warnings suppression
   - Migrated 4 test files automatically
   - Tests continue to pass with warnings suppressed

4. **Created Migration Helpers**
   - `parser_compat.py` module for test compatibility
   - Helper functions for gradual migration
   - Support for running tests with both type systems

### Deprecation Timeline

- **v0.38.0** (Current): Deprecation warnings added
- **v0.39.0**: Update all internal code to use unified types
- **v0.40.0**: Remove old dual types completely

### Migration Guide for Users

Users seeing deprecation warnings should update their code:

```python
# Old code
from psh.ast_nodes import WhileStatement
stmt = WhileStatement(condition, body, redirects)

# New code  
from psh.ast_nodes import WhileLoop, ExecutionContext
stmt = WhileLoop(
    condition=condition,
    body=body, 
    redirects=redirects,
    execution_context=ExecutionContext.STATEMENT
)
```

## Current State

The codebase now has:
1. Both old dual types (WhileStatement/WhileCommand) - deprecated with warnings
2. New unified types (WhileLoop, etc.) - fully implemented for ALL control structures
3. Parser support for unified types - feature flag controlled, supports all structures
4. Executors handle unified types - with proper context validation
5. Comprehensive test coverage - 31 new tests passing
6. Migration infrastructure - helpers, documentation, automated scripts

This incremental approach ensures we can:
- Test the new design thoroughly
- Migrate gradually without breaking existing functionality
- Provide clear deprecation timeline for users

### Progress Summary
- Phase 3.1: âœ… Create unified types
- Phase 3.2: âœ… Update parser with feature flag
- Phase 3.3: âœ… Update executors with context validation
- Phase 3.4: âœ… Migrate tests
