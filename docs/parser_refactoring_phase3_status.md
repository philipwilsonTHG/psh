# Parser Refactoring Phase 3 Status

## Phase 3.1: Create Unified Types (COMPLETED)

### What Was Done

1. **Added ExecutionContext Enum**
   - `STATEMENT`: Execute in current shell process
   - `PIPELINE`: Execute in subshell for pipeline

2. **Created UnifiedControlStructure Base Class**
   - Inherits from both `Statement` and `CompoundCommand`
   - Enables types to function in both contexts

3. **Implemented Unified Types**
   - `WhileLoop`: Unified while loop
   - `ForLoop`: Unified for loop  
   - `CStyleForLoop`: Unified C-style for loop
   - `IfConditional`: Unified if/then/else
   - `CaseConditional`: Unified case statement
   - `SelectLoop`: Unified select statement
   - `ArithmeticEvaluation`: Unified arithmetic command

4. **Key Design Decisions**
   - Used multiple inheritance (Statement + CompoundCommand)
   - Added `execution_context` field to track usage
   - Included all fields needed by both contexts
   - Avoided dataclass field ordering issues

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Type Safety**: Single type can be used in both contexts
2. **Clear Intent**: execution_context field makes usage explicit
3. **Future Ready**: Foundation for eliminating duplicate parsing logic
4. **Backward Compatible**: Old types still work

### Proof of Concept

Created and tested a demonstration showing:
- Unified types inherit from both base classes
- Execution context can be set at creation time
- Executors can check context to determine behavior
- Import system works correctly

## Phase 3.2: Update Parser (COMPLETED)

### What Was Done

1. **Added Feature Flag**
   - `_use_unified_types` flag in Parser class
   - Allows gradual migration without breaking changes
   - Can be enabled via `parse()` function parameter

2. **Updated Parsing Methods**
   - Modified `parse_while_statement()` and `parse_while_command()`
   - Modified `parse_for_statement()` and `parse_for_command()`
   - Added unified helper methods:
     - `_parse_while_unified()`
     - `_parse_for_unified()`
     - `_parse_c_style_for_unified()`

3. **Execution Context Setting**
   - Statement parsing sets `ExecutionContext.STATEMENT`
   - Pipeline component parsing sets `ExecutionContext.PIPELINE`
   - Context determines execution strategy

4. **Comprehensive Tests**
   - Created `test_unified_parser.py` with 6 tests
   - Tests cover both statement and pipeline modes
   - Verifies backward compatibility
   - Confirms inheritance hierarchy

### Implementation Details

The parser now supports both modes:
```python
# Old behavior (default)
ast = parse(tokens)  # Creates WhileStatement/WhileCommand

# New unified behavior
ast = parse(tokens, use_unified_types=True)  # Creates WhileLoop
```

When unified types are enabled:
- Control structures parsed as statements get `ExecutionContext.STATEMENT`
- Control structures parsed in pipelines get `ExecutionContext.PIPELINE`
- Same AST node type used in both contexts

## Next Steps

### Phase 3.3: Update Executors (TODO)
- Modify ControlFlowExecutor to handle unified types
- Modify PipelineExecutor to handle unified types
- Check execution_context to determine behavior

### Phase 3.4: Migrate Tests (TODO)
- Update tests to use unified types
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Add new tests for execution context

### Phase 3.5: Deprecate Old Types (TODO)
- Add deprecation warnings
- Document migration path
- Plan removal timeline

## Current State

The codebase now has:
1. Both old dual types (WhileStatement/WhileCommand) - still functional
2. New unified types (WhileLoop, etc.) - fully implemented
3. Parser support for unified types - feature flag controlled
4. Comprehensive test coverage - 6 new tests passing
5. No executor changes yet - maintaining stability

This incremental approach ensures we can:
- Test the new design thoroughly
- Migrate gradually without breaking existing functionality
- Roll back if issues are discovered

### Progress Summary
- Phase 3.1: ✅ Create unified types
- Phase 3.2: ✅ Update parser with feature flag
- Phase 3.3: ⏳ Update executors
- Phase 3.4: ⏳ Migrate tests
- Phase 3.5: ⏳ Deprecate old types
