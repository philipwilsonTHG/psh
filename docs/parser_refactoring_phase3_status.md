# Parser Refactoring Phase 3 Status

## Phase 3.1: Create Unified Types (COMPLETED)

### What Was Done

1. **Added ExecutionContext Enum**
   - `STATEMENT`: Execute in current shell process
   - `PIPELINE`: Execute in subshell for pipeline

2. **Created UnifiedControlStructure Base Class**
   - Inherits from both `Statement` and `CompoundCommand`
   - Enables types to function in both contexts

3. **Implemented Unified Types**
   - `WhileLoop`: Unified while loop
   - `ForLoop`: Unified for loop  
   - `CStyleForLoop`: Unified C-style for loop
   - `IfConditional`: Unified if/then/else
   - `CaseConditional`: Unified case statement
   - `SelectLoop`: Unified select statement
   - `ArithmeticEvaluation`: Unified arithmetic command

4. **Key Design Decisions**
   - Used multiple inheritance (Statement + CompoundCommand)
   - Added `execution_context` field to track usage
   - Included all fields needed by both contexts
   - Avoided dataclass field ordering issues

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Type Safety**: Single type can be used in both contexts
2. **Clear Intent**: execution_context field makes usage explicit
3. **Future Ready**: Foundation for eliminating duplicate parsing logic
4. **Backward Compatible**: Old types still work

### Proof of Concept

Created and tested a demonstration showing:
- Unified types inherit from both base classes
- Execution context can be set at creation time
- Executors can check context to determine behavior
- Import system works correctly

## Next Steps

### Phase 3.2: Update Parser (TODO)
- Create unified parsing methods
- Set execution_context based on parsing context
- Maintain compatibility with old types

### Phase 3.3: Update Executors (TODO)
- Modify ControlFlowExecutor to handle unified types
- Modify PipelineExecutor to handle unified types
- Check execution_context to determine behavior

### Phase 3.4: Migrate Tests (TODO)
- Update tests to use unified types
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Add new tests for execution context

### Phase 3.5: Deprecate Old Types (TODO)
- Add deprecation warnings
- Document migration path
- Plan removal timeline

## Current State

The codebase now has:
1. Both old dual types (WhileStatement/WhileCommand) - still functional
2. New unified types (WhileLoop, etc.) - ready for use
3. No parser or executor changes yet - maintaining stability

This incremental approach ensures we can:
- Test the new design thoroughly
- Migrate gradually without breaking existing functionality
- Roll back if issues are discovered
