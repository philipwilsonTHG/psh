# Shell Refactoring Phase 2 Status

## Summary
Phase 2 of the shell.py refactoring has been successfully completed. The expansion system has been extracted into dedicated components while maintaining full backward compatibility and all tests (585) continue to pass.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ExpansionManager Created ✓
- Created `expansion/manager.py` as the central orchestrator
- Manages all expansion types in the correct order
- Provides clean interface for shell to use

### 2. Variable Expansion Extracted ✓
- Created `expansion/variable.py` with VariableExpander class
- Handles all variable expansion including:
  - Simple variables ($var)
  - Braced variables (${var})
  - Parameter expansion (${var:-default})
  - Special variables ($?, $$, $!, $#, $@, $*, $0, $1-$9)
  - String variable expansion (for double quotes)

### 3. Command Substitution Extracted ✓
- Created `expansion/command_sub.py` with CommandSubstitution class
- Handles both $(...) and `...` forms
- Properly manages nested command substitutions
- Maintains correct output handling (strip trailing newlines)

### 4. Tilde Expansion Extracted ✓
- Created `expansion/tilde.py` with TildeExpander class
- Handles ~ and ~user expansions
- Proper fallback handling when HOME not set
- User lookup via pwd module

### 5. Glob Expansion Extracted ✓
- Created `expansion/glob.py` with GlobExpander class
- Handles pathname expansion with *, ?, and [...]
- Maintains bash behavior (return pattern if no matches)
- Proper sorting of results

### 6. Shell Integration ✓
- Added ExpansionManager to Shell class
- Updated all expansion methods to delegate to manager
- Removed old method bodies (kept as delegation stubs)
- Maintained full backward compatibility

## Architecture Changes

### Before:
```
shell.py (2700+ lines)
├── _expand_string_variables() 
├── _expand_variable()
├── _expand_tilde()
├── _execute_command_substitution()
├── _execute_arithmetic_expansion()
└── _expand_arguments()
```

### After:
```
shell.py (cleaner)
├── expansion_manager = ExpansionManager(self)
├── _expand_string_variables() → delegates to manager
├── _expand_variable() → delegates to manager
├── _expand_tilde() → delegates to manager
├── _execute_command_substitution() → delegates to manager
└── _execute_arithmetic_expansion() → still in shell (for now)

expansion/
├── manager.py (ExpansionManager - orchestrator)
├── variable.py (VariableExpander)
├── command_sub.py (CommandSubstitution)
├── tilde.py (TildeExpander)
└── glob.py (GlobExpander)
```

## Test Results
```
================== 585 passed, 22 skipped, 2 xfailed in 3.55s ==================
```

## Lines of Code Impact
- Removed ~200 lines from shell.py
- Added ~450 lines across expansion modules
- Net increase due to:
  - Proper class structure
  - Better documentation
  - Import management
  - Future extensibility

## Next Steps

Phase 2 is complete and ready for Phase 3: I/O Redirection. The expansion system is now modular and can be enhanced independently.

### Phase 3 Preview
1. Create IOManager in `io_redirect/manager.py`
2. Extract redirection application/restoration logic
3. Extract heredoc handling to `io_redirect/heredoc.py`
4. Extract process substitution to `io_redirect/process_sub.py`
5. Create clean context manager for redirections

## Notes
- Arithmetic expansion (_execute_arithmetic_expansion) was not moved as it already uses the separate arithmetic.py module
- The _expand_arguments method still needs to be refactored but requires more careful handling due to its complexity
- All functionality preserved with no breaking changes
- Clean separation of concerns achieved for expansion subsystem
