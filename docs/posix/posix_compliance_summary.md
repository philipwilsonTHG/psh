# PSH POSIX Compliance Assessment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the POSIX compliance assessment conducted for PSH (Python Shell) against the POSIX.1-2017 specification.

## Assessment Results

### Overall Compliance Score: **~91-93%**

Based on comprehensive analysis and automated testing (updated for v0.57.2):
- **Automated Test Score**: 92.5% (51/53 tests passing, trap now implemented)
- **Feature Analysis Score**: ~92% (weighted by importance) 
- **Real-world Script Compatibility**: ~90-93%

### Compliance by Category

| Category | Compliance | Tests Passed | Notes |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------|
| **Shell Grammar** | 95% | 100% | All control structures work perfectly |
| **Basic Commands** | 100% | 100% | Simple commands, pipelines, lists |
| **Parameter Expansion** | 85% | 71% | Some edge cases with `:=` and `:+` |
| **Special Parameters** | 95% | 100% | All POSIX special parameters work |
| **Built-in Commands** | 94% | 96% | Missing only wait, all essential builtins implemented |
| **I/O Redirection** | 90% | 80% | Minor issues with stderr and heredocs |
| **Quoting** | 100% | 100% | Perfect POSIX compliance |
| **Word Expansion** | 90% | 75% | Field splitting edge case |
| **Exit Status** | 100% | 100% | Proper exit code handling |

### Specific Test Failures

From automated testing, the following POSIX features have issues:

1. **Background job PID** (`sleep 0.1 &`) - PSH may not properly handle `$!` in all cases
2. **Parameter expansion assign** (`${var:=default}`) - Assignment not persisting correctly
3. **Parameter expansion alternative** (`${var:+alternative}`) - Not returning alternative value
4. **Subshell exit status** (`(exit 5); echo $?`) - Exit status not propagating from subshell
5. **Stderr redirection** (`echo err >&2 2>&1`) - Incorrect output handling
6. **Here document parsing** - Multi-line heredoc syntax issues
7. **Field splitting with custom IFS** - Not splitting correctly with modified IFS

## Key Strengths

### Fully Compliant Features ✅
- **Control Structures**: 100% POSIX compliant (if/while/for/case)
- **Functions**: POSIX function syntax fully supported
- **Quoting**: All three quoting types work perfectly
- **Basic I/O**: Input/output redirection works correctly
- **Command Substitution**: Both `$(...)` and backticks work
- **Arithmetic Expansion**: Full POSIX arithmetic support
- **Pattern Matching**: Glob patterns and case patterns work

### Near-Complete Features 🔧
- **Parameter Expansion**: Most forms work, minor issues with assign/alternative
- **Built-ins**: Most common POSIX built-ins implemented
- **Variables**: Special parameters and environment work well

## Critical Gaps

### Missing Built-ins (High Priority) ❌
1. **`wait`** - Process synchronization

### Recently Implemented ✅
1. **`exec`** - POSIX-compliant process replacement and FD manipulation (v0.54.0)
2. **`help`** - Bash-compatible self-documentation system (v0.55.0) 
3. **`kill`** - Send signals to processes with job control support (v0.56.0)
4. **`shift`** - Positional parameter manipulation (v0.57.0)
5. **`getopts`** - Standard option parsing (v0.57.0)
6. **`command`** - Bypass functions and aliases (v0.57.0)
7. **`trap`** - Signal handling and EXIT traps (v0.57.2)

**Major Milestone**: All essential POSIX builtins are now implemented, providing comprehensive shell scripting capabilities for argument processing, command control, and signal handling.

**Implementation Details**:
- **`shift`**: Full POSIX compliance with optional count argument, proper error handling
- **`getopts`**: Complete optstring syntax, silent error mode, OPTIND/OPTARG/OPTERR support
- **`command`**: Bypass functions/aliases with -v, -V, -p options for command lookup
- **`kill`**: Full signal management with job control integration, signal listing
- **`help`**: Bash-compatible self-documentation with pattern matching and formatting options
- **`exec`**: Process replacement and permanent I/O redirection with proper error handling
- **`trap`**: Complete signal handling with EXIT traps, signal listing, and POSIX compliance

### Parser/Execution Issues 🐛
1. Subshell exit status propagation
2. Parameter expansion edge cases (`:=`, `:+`)
3. Background job PID tracking
4. Here document multi-line parsing
5. Field splitting with custom IFS

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities (for 95%+ compliance)
1. **Implement `trap`** - Critical for signal handling (only major missing builtin)
2. **Fix parameter expansion bugs** - These are core POSIX features
3. **Fix subshell exit status** - Important for script correctness
4. **Fix stderr redirection** - Basic I/O functionality

### Medium-term Goals (for 98%+ compliance)
1. **Implement `wait`** - Process coordination  
2. **Fix here document parsing** - Common script pattern
3. **Fix field splitting with IFS** - Core shell feature
4. **Complete signal handling infrastructure**

### Long-term Enhancements
1. **Add POSIX mode** (`set -o posix`) to disable extensions
2. **Implement remaining built-ins** (`hash`, `newgrp`, `ulimit`)
3. **Complete signal handling infrastructure**
4. **Add POSIX compliance warnings**

## Testing Infrastructure

The assessment created comprehensive testing infrastructure:

1. **Test Suites** (`tests/posix_compliance/`)
   - `test_posix_builtins.py` - Built-in command tests
   - `test_posix_syntax.py` - Shell grammar tests
   - `test_posix_expansion.py` - Expansion tests

2. **Comparison Framework** (`posix_comparison_framework.py`)
   - Compares PSH behavior with reference POSIX shell
   - Normalizes output for fair comparison
   - Supports multiple POSIX shells (dash, sh, bash --posix)

3. **Compliance Checker** (`scripts/check_posix_compliance.py`)
   - Automated compliance scoring
   - Detailed failure analysis
   - JSON report generation

## Impact Assessment

### What Works Well
- **Most POSIX scripts will run correctly** in PSH
- **Educational value maintained** while achieving high compliance
- **Core shell features** are solidly implemented
- **Good foundation** for reaching higher compliance

### What Needs Work
- **Signal handling scripts** won't work without `trap`
- **Option parsing scripts** need manual handling without `getopts`
- **Some parameter expansions** may behave incorrectly
- **Complex redirections** might fail

## Recent Improvements (v0.54.0)

### POSIX-Compliant exec Builtin Implementation ✅

The latest release (v0.54.0) adds complete POSIX-compliant `exec` builtin functionality:

**Mode 1: Redirection-only exec**
- `exec > file` - Permanently redirect stdout to file
- `exec < file` - Permanently redirect stdin from file  
- `exec 2>&1` - Permanently duplicate stderr to stdout
- Full support for all redirection types and combinations

**Mode 2: Process replacement exec**
- `exec command args` - Replace shell process with command
- Proper PATH resolution and execute permission checking
- POSIX-compliant exit codes (126, 127, 1, 0)
- Environment variable assignment support
- Rejects builtins and functions with appropriate errors

**Additional Features**
- Environment variable assignments: `VAR=value exec command`
- Integration with xtrace (`set -x`) option
- Comprehensive error handling and messages
- 18 passing unit tests covering all functionality
- Bash comparison tests for POSIX compliance verification

Combined with the positional parameter builtins in v0.57.0 (shift, getopts, command), these implementations bring PSH's built-in command compliance from 75% to 92%, representing major progress toward full POSIX compatibility. All essential shell scripting builtins are now implemented.

## Conclusion

PSH achieves approximately **90-92% POSIX compliance**, which is excellent for an educational shell. The gaps are well-understood and mostly involve:
- Missing signal handling builtin (trap)
- Process synchronization builtin (wait)
- Small bugs in parameter expansion
- Edge cases in I/O handling

With the recent additions of essential builtins (exec, help, kill, shift, getopts, command) representing 6 major POSIX features, PSH now provides comprehensive shell scripting capabilities. With focused effort on the remaining high-priority items, PSH could achieve 95%+ POSIX compliance while maintaining its educational clarity and bash-compatible extensions.
