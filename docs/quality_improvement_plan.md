## Executive Summary

PSH version 0.72.0 has made significant progress as an educational shell with 1,590 passing tests and strong bash compatibility. However, analysis of 172 xfail tests and documented bugs reveals key areas for improvement. This plan prioritizes fixes based on impact, educational value, and implementation complexity.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths

### Key Issues (from xfail tests and bugs)
1. **Parameter Expansion Gaps** (19 tests, CRITICAL)
   - Missing operators: `:=`, `:?` 
   - Pattern substitution limitations
   - Positional parameter handling (`$@`, `$*`, `$#`)

2. **Interactive Features** (57 tests, 27% of xfails)
   - Tab completion not implemented
   - History functionality gaps
   - History expansion issues

3. **Error Handling** (15 tests)
   - Parser error detection gaps
   - Exit code propagation issues
   - Errexit mode not enforced properly

4. **Shell Language Features** (39 tests)

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% coverage for new code
- **Performance**: No regression in startup time or basic operations
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for leaks in new features
- **Educational Value**: Code must remain readable and well-commented

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes must pass existing tests
2. **Feature Flags**: Add flags for experimental features
3. **Rollback Plan**: Tag stable versions before major changes
4. **User Communication**: Clear documentation of breaking changes
