- **Bash Compatibility**: 83.5% (91/109 tests passing) - Updated after fixing test misclassification
- **Overall Conformance**: 91.2% identical behavior (217/238 tests)
- **Major Finding**: 95.5% of tested features work identically in PSH and bash

**Key Issues Identified:**

1. **PSH Bugs (7 issues - 2.9%)** - Updated after Phase 6a:
   - `echo \$(echo test)` - Backslash handling in command substitution
   - ✅ ~~`echo $$` - Process ID special variable not implemented~~ **FIXED in v0.80.0**
   - `sleep 1 & jobs` - Job control timing issues
   - `history` - History shows persistent history (not test-specific)
   - `alias ll="ls -l"; type ll` - Type builtin doesn't recognize aliases
   - `export VAR=value; env | grep VAR` - Export not propagating to env
   - `pushd /tmp` - Directory stack shows absolute paths

2. **Test Errors (20 issues - 8.4%)**:
   - Parameter expansion error handling (`${x:?error}`)
   - Several bash-specific features incorrectly expected to be different
   - Missing features: `shopt`, file descriptor redirection with exec
   - Alias expansion in non-interactive mode

### Remaining Skipped Tests (22 tests as of v0.79.0)

**Interactive Tests (11 tests)**:
- 10 line editing tests in `test_line_editing.py` - Require PTY/raw terminal mode
- 1 basic interactive test in `test_basic_interactive.py`
- **Note**: Created comprehensive PTY_TESTING_GUIDE.md documenting testing limitations and alternatives

**Heredoc Tests (7 tests)**:
- All in `test_heredoc.py` - Need architectural updates for proper input handling
- Heredoc functionality works but tests require stdin redirection capabilities

**Other Tests (4 tests)**:
- 1 background subshell test - Not fully implemented
- 1 RC file permissions test - Platform-specific (Unix only)

   - Implement `$$` special variable (os.getpid())
   - Fix export/env integration (simple sync issue)
   - Fix type builtin to recognize aliases
   - Fix directory stack to show relative paths
   - Estimated impact: 4-5 conformance test fixes

3. **Heredoc Architecture Investigation (Phase 6c - 3-4 days)**:
   - Analyze why 7 heredoc tests are skipped
   - Determine if it's a test infrastructure or implementation issue
   - Create plan for fixing heredoc testing
   - Estimated impact: Unblock 7 tests

4. **Background Subshells (Phase 6d - 1 week)**:
   - Implement remaining background subshell functionality
   - Fix job control timing issues
   - Estimated impact: 1-2 test fixes, better job control

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Process
1. **Test-First Approach**: Write failing tests before implementation
2. **Incremental Changes**: Small, focused commits with clear descriptions
3. **Documentation**: Update user guide and CLAUDE.md with each feature
4. **Code Review**: Self-review against educational clarity principles

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% coverage for new code
- **Performance**: No regression in startup time or basic operations
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for leaks in new features
- **Educational Value**: Code must remain readable and well-commented

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes must pass existing tests
2. **Feature Flags**: Add flags for experimental features
3. **Rollback Plan**: Tag stable versions before major changes
4. **User Communication**: Clear documentation of breaking changes

## Conformance Analysis Details

### Categories of Issues

1. **Simple Implementation Gaps** (Quick wins)
   - `$$` special variable - Just needs to return os.getpid()
   - Export/env integration - Likely a simple environment sync issue
   - Type builtin enhancement - Add alias checking to existing code

2. **Parser/Lexer Issues** (Medium complexity)
   - Backslash in command substitution - Escape sequence handling
   - File descriptor syntax in exec - Parser enhancement needed
   - Parameter expansion error syntax - Already partially implemented

3. **Architectural Challenges** (Higher complexity)
   - Alias expansion in scripts - Requires execution model changes
   - History isolation for tests - Test infrastructure issue
   - Job control timing - Inherent race conditions

### Test Classification Issues (CRITICAL UPDATE)

**Major Finding**: Analysis reveals extensive test misclassification in conformance tests.

Our `analyze_test_classification.py` script shows that **95.5% of tested commands work identically** in both PSH and bash:
- 20 out of 22 common features produce identical output
- Only `$$` shows different output (empty vs PID)
- Only `env | grep` fails (pipeline test issue)

**Features incorrectly marked as "test_error" that actually work:**
- ✓ Parameter expansion: `${var}`, `${#var}`, `${var:-default}`, `${var:+alt}` 
- ✓ Command substitution: `$(cmd)` and `` `cmd` ``
- ✓ Arithmetic expansion: `$((expr))`
- ✓ Arrays: `arr=(1 2 3); echo ${arr[0]}`
- ✓ Functions: Both `f() {}` and `function f {}` syntax
- ✓ Builtins: `type`, `export`, `declare`, `jobs`

**This means actual bash compatibility is likely >85-90% already!**

### Test Framework Root Causes

1. **Output Capture Conflicts**: PSH manipulates file descriptors directly, conflicting with pytest's capture
2. **Process Isolation**: Parallel test execution causes cross-test interference
3. **Fixture Inconsistency**: Mix of capsys, captured_shell, and subprocess approaches
4. **Misunderstood Failures**: Tests fail due to framework issues, not PSH bugs

### Phase 6: Quick Wins and Conformance (Weeks 9-10) 🚀 **NEXT**
**Goal**: Address remaining low-hanging fruit and simple conformance issues

1. **XPass Test Conversion** (2-3 days)
   - Review and fix 8 remaining xpass tests
   - Update test expectations
   - Document any real limitations found

2. **Simple Bug Fixes** (1 week)
   - Implement `$$` special variable
   - Fix export/env propagation
   - Enhance type builtin
   - Fix pushd relative paths

3. **Test Infrastructure Deep Dive** (3-4 days)
   - Investigate heredoc test skipping
   - Document or fix architectural issues
   - Create plan for remaining skipped tests

4. **Job Control Enhancements** (1 week)
   - Complete background subshell implementation
   - Fix job control race conditions
   - Improve job status reporting

## Recent Achievements Summary (v0.79.0)
