# PSH Quality Improvement Plan

## Progress Tracking

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-11  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Critical POSIX Compliance  
**Overall Progress**: 10% (1 of 10 major items completed)

### Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ Parameter expansion operators `:=` and `:?` implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite for parameter expansion
- ✅ Proper error handling and script exit behavior

### Next Priority
- Positional parameter handling (`$@`, `$*`, `$#`)

## Executive Summary

PSH version 0.72.0 has made significant progress as an educational shell with 1,590 passing tests and strong bash compatibility. However, analysis of 172 xfail tests and documented bugs reveals key areas for improvement. This plan prioritizes fixes based on impact, educational value, and implementation complexity.

## Current State Analysis

### Key Issues (from xfail tests and bugs)
1. **Parameter Expansion Gaps** (19 tests, CRITICAL)
   - Missing operators: `:=`, `:?` 
   - Pattern substitution limitations
   - Positional parameter handling (`$@`, `$*`, `$#`)

2. **Interactive Features** (57 tests, 27% of xfails)
   - Tab completion not implemented
   - History functionality gaps
   - History expansion issues

3. **Error Handling** (15 tests)
   - Parser error detection gaps
   - Exit code propagation issues
   - Errexit mode not enforced properly

4. **Shell Language Features** (39 tests)
   - Process substitution `<()`, `>()`
   - Arrays and array contexts
   - ANSI-C quoting `$'\\n'`
   - Control structure limitations

5. **Active Bugs** (from BUGS_FOUND.md)
   - Parameter expansion syntax errors (Bug #6)
   - Quote removal issues (Bug #7)
   - Array syntax over-eager parsing (Bug #13)
   - Invalid FD redirection not validated (Bug #14)
   - Errexit doesn't stop on redirection failures (Bug #15)

## Prioritized Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Critical POSIX Compliance (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Fix fundamental POSIX compliance issues affecting basic shell scripts

1. **Parameter Expansion Operators** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - ✅ Implement `:=` (assign default) operator - **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Implement `:?` (error if unset) operator - **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Pattern substitution works correctly - **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**
   - Note: `declare -a arr=(...)` syntax has parsing issues (separate bug)
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 days (2 days completed)
   - Impact: Enables many POSIX scripts to run
   - **Progress**: All core operators implemented and working

2. **Positional Parameters** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - ✅ `$@`, `$*`, `$#` handling - **ALREADY WORKING CORRECTLY**
   - ✅ IFS splitting for `$*` - **WORKING**
   - ✅ `${#@}` returns count correctly - **WORKING**
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days (0 days - already complete)
   - Impact: Critical for script compatibility
   - **Progress**: All positional parameter features working correctly

3. **Quote Processing** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Fix backslash escaping in command substitution
   - Resolve Bug #7 (quote removal issues)
   - Estimated effort: 2 days (Investigation: 1 day completed)
   - Impact: Improves script parsing reliability
   - **Progress**: Root cause analyzed - requires fundamental lexer/parser changes
   - **Status**: Complex architectural issue, documented in BUGS_FOUND.md

### Phase 2: Error Handling & Robustness (Week 3)
**Goal**: Make PSH more reliable for production use

1. **Exit Code Propagation**
   - ✅ Fix errexit mode enforcement (Bug #15) - **COMPLETED**
   - Properly propagate exit codes from subshells
   - ✅ Validate file descriptors before operations (Bug #14) - **COMPLETED**
   - Estimated effort: 3 days (1.5 days completed)
   - **Progress**: Major error handling improvements completed

2. **Parser Error Detection**
   - Detect unclosed expansions
   - Improve error messages with context
   - Fix array syntax parsing (Bug #13)
   - Estimated effort: 2 days
   - **Progress**: Not started

### Phase 3: Shell Language Features (Weeks 4-5)
**Goal**: Add missing bash features for broader compatibility

1. **Process Substitution** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Implement `<(command)` and `>(command)`
   - Integration with existing FD management
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 days
   - Impact: Enables advanced scripting patterns

2. **ANSI-C Quoting** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Implement `$'\\n'` syntax
   - Support common escape sequences
   - Estimated effort: 2 days

3. **Missing Builtins**
   - `pushd`/`popd`/`dirs` for directory stack
   - `disown` for job control
   - `printf` format specifiers
   - Estimated effort: 3 days total

### Phase 4: Interactive Features (Weeks 6-7)
**Goal**: Improve interactive shell experience

1. **Tab Completion** (24 tests)
   - Basic file/directory completion
   - Command completion
   - Variable completion
   - Estimated effort: 5 days
   - Impact: Major UX improvement

2. **History Enhancements**
   - History search functionality

   - Configuration options
   - Estimated effort: 3 days

### Phase 5: Test Infrastructure (Week 8)
**Goal**: Improve test reliability and coverage

1. **Test Framework Issues**
   - Fix output capture for eval/subprocesses
   - Improve test isolation
   - Add integration test suite
   - Estimated effort: 3 days

2. **Conformance Testing**
   - Expand bash comparison tests
   - Add POSIX conformance suite
   - Document remaining differences
   - Estimated effort: 2 days

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Process
1. **Test-First Approach**: Write failing tests before implementation
2. **Incremental Changes**: Small, focused commits with clear descriptions
3. **Documentation**: Update user guide and CLAUDE.md with each feature
4. **Code Review**: Self-review against educational clarity principles

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% coverage for new code
- **Performance**: No regression in startup time or basic operations
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for leaks in new features
- **Educational Value**: Code must remain readable and well-commented

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes must pass existing tests
2. **Feature Flags**: Add flags for experimental features
3. **Rollback Plan**: Tag stable versions before major changes
4. **User Communication**: Clear documentation of breaking changes

## Expected Outcomes

### After Phase 1-2 (3 weeks)
- POSIX compliance increased to ~96%
- Critical bugs fixed
- More reliable for production scripts

### After Phase 3-4 (7 weeks)
- Bash compatibility increased to ~80%
- Interactive experience significantly improved
- Ready for broader adoption

### After Phase 5 (8 weeks)
- Comprehensive test suite
- Well-documented differences from bash
- Solid foundation for future development

## Resource Requirements

### Developer Time
- 8 weeks of focused development
- ~40 hours per week
- Total: ~320 hours

### Testing Resources
- Access to multiple platforms (Linux, macOS)

- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Success Criteria

1. **Quantitative**
   - Reduce xfail tests from 172 to <50
   - Achieve 95%+ POSIX compliance
   - Pass 80%+ of bash comparison tests
   - Zero critical bugs in BUGS_FOUND.md

2. **Qualitative**
   - Improved user feedback on reliability

   - Better documentation and examples
   - Enhanced educational value

## Conclusion

This plan provides a structured approach to improving PSH quality while maintaining its educational mission. By focusing on critical POSIX compliance first, then expanding to convenience features, PSH can become both a reliable shell and an excellent learning tool. The modular architecture and comprehensive test suite provide a solid foundation for these improvements.
