## Recommended Next Steps (January 2025)

Following the successful implementation of here documents, here are the updated priorities:

### 1. **Complete Arithmetic Expansion Testing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
Basic implementation exists but needs verification:
- ✅ Core functionality working
- ⚠️ Add comprehensive test coverage for all operators
- ⚠️ Test complex expressions and edge cases
- ⚠️ Verify integration with other expansions
- This would complete the expansion feature set

### 2. **Implement Process Substitution Parser** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
AST foundation exists, parser implementation needed:
- ✅ ProcessSubstitution AST node exists
- ❌ Add parser support for <(...) and >(...) syntax
- ❌ Integrate with process management
- ❌ Handle error cases and cleanup
- Important for advanced I/O patterns

### 3. **Enhanced I/O Redirection** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Basic redirections work, advanced features missing:
- ✅ Basic > < >> working
- ✅ Here documents and here strings implemented
- ❌ File descriptor manipulation (exec 3< file)
- ❌ Duplication operators (2>&1, 1>&2)
- Would complete the I/O redirection feature matrix

### 4. **Array Support** (LOW PRIORITY)
Foundation exists but parser implementation needed:
- ❌ Array literal parsing (arr=(a b c))
- ❌ Subscript parsing (${arr[0]})
- ❌ Array expansion (${arr[@]}, ${arr[*]})
- ❌ Associative arrays (declare -A)
- Less commonly used but important for advanced scripts

### 5. **Parser Enhancements** (LOW PRIORITY)
Quality of life improvements:
- ❌ Better error recovery and reporting
- ❌ Performance optimizations
- ❌ Incremental parsing support

## Why This Order?

1. **Arithmetic Expansion Testing** would complete the expansion feature set
2. **Process Substitution** adds advanced I/O capabilities
3. **Advanced Redirection** completes the I/O feature matrix
4. **Arrays** are less commonly used but important for advanced scripts
5. **Parser Enhancements** improve user experience once features work

## Current Status Summary

### ✅ Fully Implemented Features:
- **Function Definitions**: All 3 syntax forms (POSIX, keyword, keyword+parens)
- **Command Substitution**: Both $() and backtick styles with nested parsing
- **Parameter Expansion**: All operators (:-=?+#%/^,) with pattern matching
- **Control Structures**: if/while/for/case with proper nesting
- **Here Documents**: <<, <<-, and <<< with two-pass parsing architecture
- **Basic I/O Redirection**: >, <, >>, 2>, 2>>, >&, <<<
- **Pipelines**: Simple and complex pipelines with control structures
- **And-or Lists**: && and || operators
- **Background Jobs**: & operator parsing
- **Word AST**: Complete integration with expansion system

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented:
- **Arithmetic Expansion**: Core working, needs comprehensive test coverage
- **Advanced Redirections**: Basic forms work, FD manipulation missing

### ❌ Not Implemented:
- **Process Substitution**: Parser implementation needed
- **Arrays**: Literal parsing and subscripts
- **Compound Commands**: Subshells and brace groups  
- **Select Loops**: Interactive menu support

## Implementation Tips

- Use the existing Word AST infrastructure for all expansions
- Maintain backward compatibility with string-based parsing
- Add comprehensive tests for each feature
