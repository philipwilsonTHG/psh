# Appendix E: Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for common shell scripting terms and concepts used throughout the PSH User's Guide. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy reference.

**Argument**  
A value passed to a command or function. Also called a parameter.  
Example: In `ls -l /home`, `-l` and `/home` are arguments.

The process of evaluating mathematical expressions within `$((...))`.  
Example: `echo $((2 + 3))` outputs `5`
