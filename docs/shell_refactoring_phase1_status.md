# Shell Refactoring Phase 1 Status

## Summary
Phase 1 of the shell.py refactoring has been successfully completed. All infrastructure is in place and all tests (585) are passing.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Directory Structure ✓
Created all required directories:
- `psh/core/` - Core infrastructure
- `psh/executor/` - Execution components  
- `psh/expansion/` - Expansion system
- `psh/io_redirect/` - I/O redirection
- `psh/scripting/` - Script handling
- `psh/interactive/` - Interactive features
- `psh/utils/` - Utilities

### 2. Core Components ✓
- `core/exceptions.py` - Extracted LoopBreak and LoopContinue exceptions
- `core/state.py` - Created ShellState class with all shell state
- `executor/base.py` - Base class for executor components
- `expansion/base.py` - Base class for expansion components

### 3. Utility Components ✓
- `utils/ast_formatter.py` - AST formatting for debug output
- `utils/token_formatter.py` - Token formatting for debug output

### 4. Shell Class Updates ✓
- Integrated ShellState into Shell class
- Added backward compatibility layer using `__getattr__` and `__setattr__`
- Updated imports to use new modules
- Delegated formatting methods to new utility classes
- Preserved all existing functionality

### 5. Test Infrastructure ✓
- Created `tests/helpers/shell_factory.py` for test shell creation
- All 585 tests passing without modification
- No functionality regression

## Current State

The shell is now using a hybrid architecture:
- Shell state is managed by the ShellState class
- Exceptions are imported from core.exceptions
- Formatting utilities are delegated to utils modules
- Full backward compatibility maintained through property delegation

## Files Modified
1. `psh/shell.py` - Updated imports and added state management
2. `psh/shell.py.backup_phase1` - Backup of original shell.py
3. New files created as per directory structure above

## Test Results
```
================== 585 passed, 22 skipped, 2 xfailed in 3.55s ==================
```

## Next Steps

Phase 1 is complete and ready for Phase 2: Expansion System. The infrastructure is in place to begin extracting expansion methods into dedicated components.

### Phase 2 Preview
1. Create ExpansionManager in `expansion/manager.py`
2. Extract variable expansion methods to `expansion/variable.py`
3. Extract command substitution to `expansion/command_sub.py`
4. Extract glob expansion to `expansion/glob.py`
5. Extract tilde expansion to `expansion/tilde.py`

## Notes
- No breaking changes introduced
- All functionality preserved
- Clean separation of concerns established
- Ready for incremental refactoring in subsequent phases
