0.80.9 (2025-01-14) - Quality Improvements and Test Fixes
  - Fixed eval complex expression test (test bug, not PSH bug)
    - Variable expansion in double quotes was happening before eval
    - Fixed by properly escaping $ in test: eval "for i in 1 2 3; do echo \\$i; done"
  - Completed comprehensive arithmetic expansion support:
    - History expansion fix: !0 in $((!0)) no longer treated as history reference
    - Nested arithmetic: $(($((X + 1)) * $((Y + 1)))) now works correctly
    - Base notation: 2#1010, 8#77, 16#FF, 36#Z all supported (bases 2-36)
    - Error handling: Division by zero and syntax errors properly fail commands
  - Reduced xfail test count from 115 to 111
  - Identified remaining test failures as test infrastructure issues, not PSH bugs
  - All arithmetic expansion tests now pass with full bash compatibility

0.80.8 (2025-01-14) - Complete Arithmetic Expansion Support
  - Added base notation support for arithmetic expressions (base#number)
    - Supports bases 2-36: 2#1010, 8#77, 16#FF, 36#Z
    - Full compatibility with bash base notation syntax
    - Validates base range and digit validity for each base
  - Fixed arithmetic error handling to match bash behavior
    - Arithmetic errors now properly fail the entire command (exit code 1)
    - Division by zero and syntax errors stop command execution
    - Error messages printed to stderr like bash
  - All arithmetic expansion tests now pass
  - Examples:
    - $((2#1010)) → 10 (binary)
    - $((16#FF)) → 255 (hexadecimal)
    - $((36#Z)) → 35 (base 36)
    - echo $((1/0)) → error with exit code 1

0.80.7 (2025-01-13) - Nested Arithmetic Expansion Support
  - Added support for nested arithmetic expansions like $(($((X + 1)) * $((Y + 1))))
  - Fixed issue where nested $((...)) inside arithmetic was treated as command substitution
  - Modified _expand_command_subs_in_arithmetic to distinguish between:
    - $((...)) - nested arithmetic expansion (recursively evaluated)
    - $(...) - command substitution (executed as command)
  - Now correctly handles arbitrary nesting depth of arithmetic expressions
  - Examples that now work:
    - $(($((X + 1)) * $((Y + 1)))) with X=2, Y=3 → 12
    - $(($(($(($((A + 1)) + 1)) + 1)) * 2)) with A=1 → 8
    - Mixed: $(($((X)) + $(echo 3))) with X=5 → 8
  - All nested arithmetic tests now pass and match bash behavior

0.80.6 (2025-01-13) - Tab Completion Tilde Expansion Fix
  - Fixed tab completion adding backslash before tilde in paths like ~/src/psh/README.md
  - Tilde was incorrectly included in the list of special characters to escape
  - Now tilde at the beginning of a path is preserved for home directory expansion
  - Tilde in the middle of paths (e.g., file~backup) is left unescaped as it has no special meaning
  - Other special characters (spaces, $, quotes, etc.) are still properly escaped
  - Added comprehensive unit tests for tilde handling in tab completion
  - Example: ls ~/src/psh/READ<TAB> now completes to ls ~/src/psh/README.md (not ls <backslash>~/src/psh/README.md)

0.80.5 (2025-01-13) - Fixed Escape Sequence Processing for Bash Compatibility
  - Fixed escape sequence processing to match bash behavior for \\$\\(echo test\\)
  - Removed special case handling for \\$ that prevented other escapes from being processed
  - The expansion manager was treating \\$\\(echo as a special case, replacing only \\$ with $
  - Now all escape sequences in the argument are processed uniformly:
    - \\$ → $
    - \\( → (
    - \\) → )
  - PSH now outputs $(echo test) matching bash, instead of $\\(echo test)
  - Fixed by removing lines 137-141 in expansion/manager.py that special-cased \\$
  - All 7 escaped dollar conformance tests now pass
  - This completes the user request to match bash behavior for escaped parentheses

0.80.4 (2025-01-13) - Parser Fix for Escaped Dollar Followed by Parenthesis
  - Fixed parser to correctly reject \\$( as a syntax error matching bash behavior
    - Bash treats echo \\$(echo test) as "syntax error near unexpected token '('"
    - PSH was incorrectly accepting this and executing as separate tokens
  - Enhanced parser's parse_pipeline_component to check for escaped dollar before LPAREN
    - Detects when previous token ends with \\$ (odd number of backslashes before $)
    - Properly handles cases like \\$( and \\\\\\$( as syntax errors
    - Allows valid cases like \\\\$(cmd) where dollar is not escaped
  - Added comprehensive test suite for escaped dollar syntax
    - 8 tests covering all variations of escaped dollar with parenthesis
    - Tests verify PSH matches bash behavior exactly
  - Created conformance tests documenting this bash compatibility improvement
    - Note: PSH differs from bash on \\$\\(echo test\\) output formatting
  - This fix improves bash compatibility and prevents confusing behavior
    - Users attempting escaped dollar + command substitution get clear error
    - Consistent with POSIX shell syntax requirements

0.80.3 (2025-01-13) - Pushd Logical Path Preservation
  - Fixed pushd to preserve logical paths instead of resolving symlinks
    - Now correctly shows /tmp instead of /private/tmp on macOS
    - Uses PWD environment variable to track logical working directory
    - Directory stack initialization now uses PWD instead of os.getcwd()
  - Fixes conformance test where PSH and bash output differed
    - Both shells now show identical directory stacks
    - Symlink paths are preserved as entered by the user
  - Added comprehensive test suite for logical path handling
    - Tests for symlink preservation
    - Tests for /tmp special case on macOS
    - Tests for PWD vs physical path distinction
    - All 4 new tests passing
  - This completes another PSH bug fix from conformance testing
    - 4 out of 7 original PSH bugs now fixed
    - Improves bash compatibility for directory navigation

0.80.2 (2025-01-13) - Type Builtin Implementation
  - Implemented the type builtin command for command type information
    - Shows whether a command is an alias, function, builtin, or file
    - Supports all standard options: -a, -f, -p, -P, -t
    - Correctly handles precedence: aliases > functions > builtins > PATH
    - Comprehensive test suite with 14 tests covering all functionality
  - Fixes conformance issue where type builtin didn't recognize aliases
    - The original conformance test showed PSH calling /usr/bin/type
    - Now PSH uses its builtin type command for proper alias recognition
  - Type builtin features:
    - type NAME: Shows what kind of command NAME is
    - type -t NAME: Shows just the type (alias/function/builtin/file)
    - type -a NAME: Shows all possible matches in order
    - type -p NAME: Shows path only (excludes builtins/functions/aliases)
    - type -P NAME: Forces PATH search even for builtins
    - type -f NAME: Suppresses function lookup
  - All type builtin tests passing (100% coverage)

0.80.1 (2025-01-13) - Export/Env Synchronization Fix
  - Fixed export/env synchronization issue where exported variables weren't visible in env output
    - Updated export_variable to sync to both shell.env and os.environ
    - Enhanced sync_exports_to_environment to update os.environ
    - Fixed env builtin to use shell.env when in forked child (pipeline)
    - Ensured consistency between builtin env and external /usr/bin/env
  - Added comprehensive test suite for env builtin functionality
    - Tests for direct env, pipeline env, export synchronization
    - Tests for multiple exports and export without value
    - All 7 env builtin tests now passing
  - Export/env propagation now works correctly in all contexts
    - Direct execution: export VAR=value; env shows the variable
    - Pipeline execution: export VAR=value; env | grep VAR works
    - External commands see exported variables correctly

0.80.0 (2025-01-13) - $$ Special Variable Implementation and Test Fixes
