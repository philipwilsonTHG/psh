# Executor Subsystem

This document provides guidance for working with the PSH executor subsystem.

## Architecture Overview

The executor transforms AST nodes into executed commands using a **visitor pattern** with delegation to specialized executors. All process creation goes through a unified `ProcessLauncher`.

```
AST → ExecutorVisitor → Specialized Executors → ProcessLauncher → OS
              ↓
    ┌─────────┼──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
    ↓         ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓
Command  Pipeline  ControlFlow  Function  Subshell
Executor  Executor   Executor   Executor  Executor
```

## Core Patterns

### 1. Visitor Pattern

`ExecutorVisitor` dispatches to `visit_*` methods based on AST node type:

```python
class ExecutorVisitor:
    def visit(self, node):
        method = getattr(self, f'visit_{type(node).__name__}', None)
        if method:
            return method(node)
        raise NotImplementedError(f"No visitor for {type(node)}")

    def visit_SimpleCommand(self, node): ...
    def visit_Pipeline(self, node): ...
    def visit_IfConditional(self, node): ...
```

### 2. Strategy Pattern for Commands

Commands are dispatched through execution strategies in priority order:

```python
# In command.py
EXECUTION_ORDER = [
    SpecialBuiltinExecutionStrategy(),  # : break continue eval exec exit export ...
    BuiltinExecutionStrategy(),          # cd echo pwd test [ ...
    FunctionExecutionStrategy(),         # User-defined functions
    AliasExecutionStrategy(),            # Aliases
    ExternalExecutionStrategy()          # External programs
]
```

### 3. Unified Process Creation

All forked processes go through `ProcessLauncher`:

```python
class ProcessLauncher:
    def launch(self, config: ProcessConfig, child_action: Callable) -> int:
        """Fork and execute with proper job control setup."""
        # 1. Create sync pipes for process group coordination
        # 2. Fork
        # 3. Child: setup process group, signals, I/O, then exec
        # 4. Parent: add to job table, manage foreground/background
```

### 4. Process Roles

```python
class ProcessRole(Enum):
    SINGLE = "single"              # Standalone command
    PIPELINE_LEADER = "leader"     # First process in pipeline (creates pgroup)
    PIPELINE_MEMBER = "member"     # Subsequent pipeline processes
```

## Execution Flow

### Simple Command Execution

```
SimpleCommand AST
    ↓
CommandExecutor.execute_simple_command()
    ↓
1. Expand assignments
2. Expand arguments (variables, globs, etc.)
3. Try each execution strategy in order
    ↓
BuiltinExecutionStrategy.execute()  -- or --  ExternalExecutionStrategy.execute()
    ↓                                              ↓
Builtin.execute()                        ProcessLauncher.launch()
    ↓                                              ↓
Exit code                                   fork() + execvp()
```

### Pipeline Execution

```
Pipeline AST
    ↓
PipelineExecutor.execute_pipeline()
    ↓
1. Create pipes between commands
2. Fork each command:
   - First: PIPELINE_LEADER (creates process group)
   - Rest: PIPELINE_MEMBER (joins process group)
3. Wait for all processes
4. Return exit code (last command, or first failure if pipefail)
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Builtin

1. Create builtin in `psh/builtins/mybuiltin.py`:
```python
from .builtin_base import Builtin, builtin

@builtin
class MyBuiltin(Builtin):
    name = "mybuiltin"

    def execute(self, args: List[str], shell: 'Shell') -> int:
        # args[0] is the command name
        # Return exit code (0 = success)
        return 0
```

2. The `@builtin` decorator auto-registers it

3. Add tests in `tests/unit/builtins/`

### Adding a New Control Structure

1. Add AST node in `psh/ast_nodes.py`

2. Add parser support in `psh/parser/`

3. Add visitor method in `core.py`:
```python
def visit_MyStructure(self, node):
    return self.control_flow.execute_my_structure(node)
```

4. Add execution in `control_flow.py`:
```python
def execute_my_structure(self, node) -> int:
    # Execute the structure
    return exit_code
```

### Modifying Process Creation

All process creation goes through `ProcessLauncher`. To modify:

1. Add configuration to `ProcessConfig`:
```python
@dataclass
class ProcessConfig:
    role: ProcessRole
    pgid: Optional[int] = None
    foreground: bool = True
    # Add new fields here
```

2. Handle in `ProcessLauncher._child_setup_and_exec()`

## Key Implementation Details

### Signal Handling

Child processes reset signal handlers via `reset_child_signals()`.
The `is_shell_process` flag on `ProcessConfig` controls SIGTTOU disposition:

- **Shell processes** (`is_shell_process=True`): Keep SIGTTOU=SIG_IGN so they
  can call `tcsetpgrp()` for job control (subshells, brace groups).
- **Leaf processes** (`is_shell_process=False`, default): SIGTTOU=SIG_DFL,
  appropriate for external commands that don't manage terminal control.

```python
# In process_launcher.py _child_setup_and_exec():
self.signal_manager.reset_child_signals()  # Sets all signals to SIG_DFL
if config.is_shell_process:
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTTOU, signal.SIG_IGN)  # Restore for shell processes
```

Note: `process_sub.py` applies the same SIGTTOU policy manually since it
uses raw `os.fork()` rather than `ProcessLauncher`.

### Process Group Management

- Pipeline leader creates new process group: `os.setpgid(0, 0)`
- Members join leader's group: `os.setpgid(0, leader_pid)`
- Foreground processes get terminal: `tcsetpgrp()`

### Expansion Order

POSIX-compliant expansion order:
1. Brace expansion (non-POSIX)
2. Tilde expansion
3. Parameter/variable expansion
4. Command substitution
5. Arithmetic expansion
6. Word splitting (on unquoted results)
7. Pathname expansion (globbing)
8. Quote removal

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | General error |
| 2 | Misuse of builtin |
| 126 | Command not executable |
| 127 | Command not found |
| 128+N | Killed by signal N |

## Testing

```bash
# Run executor tests (integration tests)
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Test specific control structure
python -m pytest tests/integration/control_flow/ -v

# Test pipelines (requires special handling)
python run_tests.py  # Uses smart test runner

# Debug execution
python -m psh --debug-exec -c "echo hello | cat"
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Fork in Tests**: Tests using subshells must run with `-s` flag due to pytest's output capture interfering with file descriptors in forked children.

2. **Signal Safety**: Don't call non-async-signal-safe functions after `fork()` before `exec()`.

3. **Process Group Timing**: Use sync pipes to ensure process group is set up before parent continues.

4. **Expansion Context**: Some expansions (like `$@`) behave differently in quotes vs unquoted.

5. **Exit Code Propagation**: Control structures must properly propagate exit codes from their bodies.

## Debug Options

```bash
python -m psh --debug-exec      # Process creation, signals, job control
python -m psh --debug-expansion # Variable and command substitution
```

## Integration Points

### With Shell State (`psh/core/state.py`)

- Variables: `shell.state.variables`
- Exit code: `shell.state.last_exit_status`
- Options: `shell.state.options` (errexit, pipefail, etc.)

### With Job Control (`psh/job_control.py`)

- Job table: `shell.job_manager`
- Background jobs: `Job` objects with process group info

### With I/O Manager (`psh/io_manager.py`)

- Redirections: `io_manager.setup_redirects()`
- Heredocs: `io_manager.setup_heredoc()`
- File descriptor management
