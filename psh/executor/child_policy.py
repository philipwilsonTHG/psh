"""Unified child process signal policy.

Every fork path must call apply_child_signal_policy() immediately after
os.fork() in the child branch. This ensures consistent signal handling
across ProcessLauncher, command substitution, process substitution, and
redirect process substitution forks.

    This is the single source of truth for child process signal setup.

        1. Mark state as forked child
        2. Temporarily ignore SIGTTOU (prevents STOP during setup)
        3. Reset all signals to SIG_DFL via signal_manager

           call tcsetpgrp() and must not be stopped by SIGTTOU)
