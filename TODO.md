Features ordered by ease of implementation, from simplest to most complex.

## Easy Features (1-2 hours each)

### 1. âœ… Additional Built-in Commands
- [x] `pwd` - Print working directory
- [x] `echo` - Print arguments (with proper quote handling)
- [x] `env` - Display environment variables
- [x] `unset` - Remove environment variables
- [x] `source` or `.` - Execute commands from file

### 2. âœ… Exit Status Handling
- [x] Set `$?` variable to last command's exit code
- [x] Display exit status in prompt when non-zero
- [x] Make exit status available to shell scripts

### 3. âœ… Command History
- [x] Store command history in memory
- [x] `history` built-in command
- [x] Up/down arrow navigation (using readline)
- [x] Save history to ~/.psh_history

## Medium Features (3-5 hours each)

### 4. âœ… Pipeline Execution
- [x] Implement actual pipe functionality between processes
- [x] Handle pipeline exit status (last command's status)
- [x] Proper signal handling in pipelines

### 5. ðŸ”§ Wildcards/Globbing

- [ ] Job notifications when complete

### 9. ðŸš€ Command Substitution
- [ ] Implement $(...) syntax
- [ ] Implement backtick syntax
- [ ] Nested command substitution
- [ ] Proper quote handling within substitutions

### 10. ðŸš€ Aliases and Functions
- [ ] `alias` built-in command
- [ ] Alias expansion during parsing
- [ ] Basic function definition syntax
- [ ] Function invocation

### 11. ðŸš€ Control Structures
- [ ] `if`/`then`/`else`/`fi`
- [ ] `while`/`do`/`done`
- [ ] `for` loops (both styles)
- [ ] `case`/`esac` statements
- [ ] `&&` and `||` operators

## Advanced Features (Multiple days)

### 12. ðŸŽ¯ Arithmetic Expansion
- [ ] $((...)) arithmetic evaluation

- [ ] Tilde expansion (~, ~user)
- [ ] Advanced parameter expansion (${var%pattern}, etc.)
- [ ] Process substitution (<(...), >(...))

### 14. ðŸŽ¯ Script Support
- [ ] Execute .psh scripts
- [ ] Shebang support
- [ ] Script arguments
- [ ] `set` options (-e, -u, -x, etc.)
- [ ] Error handling and trap

### 15. ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Enhancements
- [ ] Tab completion for commands
- [ ] Tab completion for files
- [ ] Syntax highlighting
- [ ] Multi-line command editing
- [ ] Custom prompts (PS1, PS2)

## Implementation Notes

### Starting Points

1. **Built-ins are easiest** - Just add to the `execute_command` method
2. **Pipeline execution** - Critical missing feature, good learning experience
3. **History** - Use Python's `readline` module for quick implementation
4. **Wildcards** - Use `glob` module from standard library

### Testing Strategy

- Create test scripts for each feature
- Build a test harness that compares psh output with bash
- Focus on POSIX compliance where reasonable

### Architecture Considerations

- Keep parser additions clean and well-documented
- Maintain separation between parsing and execution
- Consider creating a separate module for built-ins
- Add integration tests as features are implemented

### Learning Goals

Each feature teaches different concepts:
- Built-ins â†’ Command dispatch patterns
- Pipelines â†’ Process management and IPC
- Job control â†’ Signal handling
- Control structures â†’ Interpreter design
- Expansions â†’ String processing and parsing complexity

Start with easy features to build momentum, then tackle medium features that add significant functionality. Hard features may require parser restructuring.
