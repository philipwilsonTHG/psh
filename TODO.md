## ðŸš¨ Known Issues & Limitations

### Architectural Limitations
- ~~**Nested Control Structures**~~: âœ… FIXED in v0.19.0 - Control structures can now be nested to arbitrary depth with the new Statement-based architecture
- **Multi-line Input Parsing**: Complex multi-line commands with nested structures fail to parse correctly. Single-line equivalents work fine.
- **Pipeline Job Control Issues**: Some pipelines are incorrectly treated as background jobs instead of running in foreground.
- **For Loop Variable Persistence**: Loop variables are incorrectly restored to their previous value after the loop completes. In bash, they retain their last iteration value.
- **Builtin Redirections**: Builtins that use Python's `print()` function (like echo, pwd) don't respect file descriptor redirections. They need to be updated to use `os.write()` directly to file descriptors for proper redirection support.
- **Control Structures in Pipelines**: Control structures (while, for, if, case) cannot be used as part of pipelines. For example, `echo "data" | while read line; do echo $line; done` fails to parse. This is a fundamental parser architecture limitation where pipelines expect Command objects, not control structures. Workaround: Use the control structure to wrap the entire pipeline instead.

### Tokenizer Issues
- **Arithmetic Expansion in Assignments**: The tokenizer incorrectly breaks `c=$((a + b))` into separate tokens because `read_word()` stops at `(`. This should tokenize as `WORD='c='` followed by `ARITH_EXPANSION='$((a + b))'`.
- **Stderr Redirection**: The tokenizer incorrectly tokenizes `>&2` as three separate tokens (`>`, `&`, `2`) instead of recognizing it as a redirect duplication operator. This causes parser failures with "Expected file name after redirection" errors.
- **Arithmetic Inside Quotes**: Arithmetic expansion inside double quotes (e.g., `echo "Result: $((2 + 2))"`) is not being expanded because `_expand_string_variables()` only handles variable expansion, not arithmetic expansion.
- **Variable Assignment with Quoted Values** (NEW - discovered v0.20.1): The tokenizer doesn't handle `VAR="value with spaces"` correctly when it appears before a command. For example, `MSG="hello world" echo $MSG` fails with "world": command not found" because the quoted value is split incorrectly.

### Parser Edge Cases
- **Empty Commands**: Consecutive semicolons (`;;`, `;;;`) are not handled gracefully in command parsing (though they work correctly in case statements).
- **Complex Quoting**: Some edge cases with complex nested quoting and escaping may not parse correctly.
- **EOF Cascade Errors**: When early parsing fails (e.g., redirect errors), the parser continues looking for closing keywords (`fi`, `done`) but hits EOF, causing cascading "Expected FI/DONE, got EOF" errors.
- ~~**Command Substitution in For Loops**~~: âœ… FIXED in v0.19.3 - Command substitution `$(...)` and backticks are now properly parsed and executed in for loop iterables. The parser accepts COMMAND_SUB tokens and the executor expands them with word splitting.
- **Break/Continue Parsing**: The parser returns break/continue as statements, but some tests expect them as and_or_lists, indicating a mismatch between parser output and test expectations.
- **Break/Continue with Operators**: Using break/continue after && or || operators (e.g., `echo "test" && break`) causes parse errors.

### Workarounds in Use
- Tests use single-line command syntax to avoid multi-line parsing issues
- ~~Nested control structure tests are skipped with clear documentation~~ - No longer needed after v0.19.0
- Some pipeline tests are skipped due to job control issues
- Avoid stderr redirection (`>&2`) in scripts; use `2>&1` or file redirection instead
- Avoid arithmetic expansion inside quotes; use unquoted arithmetic or concatenation
- ~~Use explicit lists in for loops instead of command substitution~~ - No longer needed after v0.19.3
- Avoid quoted values in variable assignments before commands; use `VAR=value` without quotes or set the variable on a separate line
- Don't rely on loop variables persisting after the loop; save to a different variable if needed
- Avoid using break/continue after && or || operators; use if statements instead

### Future Improvements Needed
1. ~~**AST Architecture Redesign**~~: âœ… COMPLETED in v0.19.0 - Implemented Statement base class and StatementList with full nesting support
2. **Multi-line Parser Enhancement**: Improve newline and indentation handling
3. **Job Control Refinement**: Fix pipeline classification between foreground/background
4. **Tokenizer Fixes**:
   - Fix `read_word()` to handle arithmetic expansion that starts within a word
   - Add proper tokenization for redirect duplication operators (`>&`, `<&`)
   - Enhance `_expand_string_variables()` to also handle arithmetic expansion inside strings
   - Fix tokenization of `VAR="value with spaces"` to keep the assignment as a single token
5. **Parser Error Recovery**: Improve error handling to avoid cascade errors when early parsing fails
6. ~~**For Loop Enhancement**~~: âœ… COMPLETED in v0.19.3 - parse_for_statement() now accepts COMMAND_SUB tokens and executor properly expands them
7. **For Loop Variable Scoping**: Fix execute_for_statement to preserve loop variable value after loop completion (match bash behavior)
8. **Break/Continue Parser Integration**: Allow break/continue statements in and_or_lists for use after operators
9. **Fix Builtin Redirections**: Update all builtins that use `print()` to use `os.write()` directly to file descriptors. This includes:
   - echo, pwd (in io.py)
   - env, set, declare, alias (output commands)
   - history, jobs (listing commands)
   - Any other builtin that produces output

## ðŸ“‹ Test Suite Skip Status

### Currently Skipped Tests (22 total as of v0.22.0)
Analysis of skipped tests reveals they fall into several categories:

#### Tests that CAN be fixed or rewritten (14 tests):
1. **CI-only skips (2 tests)** - Already work locally:
   - `test_stderr_redirect.py:75, 100` - Stderr redirection tests (skip only on GitHub Actions)
   - `test_command_substitution.py:179` - Command substitution in pipeline (skip only on GitHub Actions)

2. **Minor implementation fixes needed (5 tests)**:
   - `test_variables.py:111` - `$!` variable test - Implementation exists, might need minor fixes
   - `test_variable_assignment_command.py:99` - VAR="value with spaces" tokenizer issue (documented)
   - `test_tilde_expansion.py:124` - Escaped tilde handling (tokenizer removes backslashes too early)
   - `test_break_continue.py:86, 111` - For loop variable persistence issue (fixable)

3. **Pytest capture conflicts (7 tests)** - Need rewriting to use file output:
   - `test_glob.py:192` - Glob expansion in pipeline
   - `test_heredoc.py:105, 133` - Heredoc with external commands and pipelines
   - `test_nested_control_structures.py:342, 382, 422` - Nested control structures with pipelines
   - `test_pipeline.py:77` - Built-in commands in pipelines
   - `test_builtin_refactor.py:119` - Built-in commands in pipelines

#### Tests that need architectural changes (8 tests):
1. **Parser/AST changes needed (3 tests)**:
   - `test_break_continue.py:369` - Parser returns statements, not and_or_lists for break/continue
   - `test_break_continue.py:395` - Break after && operator causes parse errors
   - `test_break_continue.py:425` - For loop variable restoration issue

2. **Complex features not implemented (5 tests)**:
   - `test_nested_control_structures.py:232` - Requires `read` builtin (âœ… implemented in v0.20.1 - can be unskipped)
   - `test_glob.py:224` - Requires escaped glob pattern support (not implemented)
   - `test_command_substitution.py:160` - Complex backtick escape sequences (needs tokenizer work)
   - `test_heredoc.py:118` - Multiple redirections with heredocs (needs special handling)
   - `test_builtin_phase2.py` - Unknown status (file not examined)

### Test Improvement Recommendations
1. **Immediate actions**:
   - Remove `skipif` decorators for CI-only tests when running locally
   - Fix `test_variables.py:111` - the `$!` test might already work
   - Unskip `test_nested_control_structures.py:232` - read builtin was implemented in v0.20.1
   - Enable 11 break/continue tests from `test_break_continue.py.disabled` (âœ… Done - 11 now pass, 5 skipped)

2. **Test rewriting needed**:
   - Convert pytest capture tests to use file-based output verification
   - Create helper functions for testing pipeline output
   - Use script files for complex multi-line heredoc tests

3. **Implementation fixes needed**:
   - Fix for loop variable persistence (should retain last value after loop)
   - Fix tokenizer for VAR="value with spaces" assignments
   - Enhance parser to handle break/continue after && or || operators

4. **Keep skipped until features implemented**:
   - Escaped glob pattern tests
   - Complex escape sequence tests
   - Multiple redirections with heredocs
