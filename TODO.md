## ðŸš§ In Progress / Remaining Features

### Easy-Medium Features

#### Command Separators

- [ ] `jobs` command to list jobs
- [ ] `fg` command to bring job to foreground
- [ ] `bg` command to resume suspended job in background
- [ ] Ctrl-Z (SIGTSTP) to suspend foreground job
- [ ] Job notifications when background jobs complete
- [ ] %job notation for referring to jobs

#### Aliases
- [x] `alias` built-in command
- [x] Alias expansion during tokenization
- [x] Recursive alias prevention
- [x] `unalias` command

#### Shell Functions
- [ ] Function definition syntax: `name() { commands; }`

- [ ] Return values from functions

### Very Hard Features (Multiple days)

#### Control Structures

- [ ] `test` or `[` command for conditionals

#### Arithmetic Expansion
- [ ] `$((...))` arithmetic evaluation
- [ ] Basic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **)
- [ ] Comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)
- [ ] Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- [ ] Variable references in arithmetic
- [ ] C-style increment/decrement (++, --)

#### Advanced Expansions
- [ ] Brace expansion (`{a,b,c}`, `{1..10}`)
- [x] Tilde expansion (`~`, `~user`)
- [ ] Advanced parameter expansion:
  - [ ] `${var#pattern}` - Remove shortest prefix
  - [ ] `${var##pattern}` - Remove longest prefix
  - [ ] `${var%pattern}` - Remove shortest suffix
  - [ ] `${var%%pattern}` - Remove longest suffix
  - [ ] `${var/pattern/replacement}` - Pattern substitution
  - [ ] `${#var}` - String length
- [ ] Process substitution (`<(...)`, `>(...)`)

#### Script Support
- [ ] Execute .psh scripts from files
- [ ] Shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env psh`) support
- [ ] Script arguments ($0, $@, etc.)
- [ ] `set` options:
  - [ ] `-e` (errexit) - Exit on error
  - [ ] `-u` (nounset) - Error on undefined variables
  - [ ] `-x` (xtrace) - Print commands before execution
  - [ ] `-o pipefail` - Pipeline fails if any command fails
- [ ] `trap` command for signal handling
- [ ] `exit` with cleanup

#### Interactive Enhancements
- [ ] Tab completion for commands
- [x] Tab completion for files/directories
- [ ] Programmable completion
- [ ] Syntax highlighting in prompt
- [ ] Multi-line command editing with PS2
- [ ] Custom prompts (PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4)
- [x] Vi/Emacs key bindings (set -o vi/emacs)
- [x] Command line editing shortcuts (Ctrl-A/E, Ctrl-K/U, Ctrl-R for history search, etc.)

## Implementation Priorities

### Next Features to Implement

1. **Job control basics** - Start with jobs tracking and notifications
2. **Simple control structures** - Start with `if`/`then`/`else`
3. **Basic arithmetic expansion** - `$((...))` 
4. **Shell functions** - Function definition and invocation

### Architecture Considerations

#### Lessons from && and || Implementation
- Grammar changes can require AST restructuring
- Backward compatibility important for existing tests
- Short-circuit evaluation requires careful exit status tracking
- Operator precedence affects grammar design

#### For Control Structures
- Need to extend AST significantly
- Consider separate parsing mode for multi-line constructs
- May need lookahead in tokenizer

#### For Job Control
- Need job table data structure
- Process group management is crucial
- Signal handling becomes more complex

#### For Advanced Expansions
- Order of expansions matters (follow POSIX)
- Need careful quote handling
- Some expansions happen at different phases

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each component (tokenizer, parser, executor)
- Integration tests comparing with bash output
- Edge case testing for each feature
- Performance testing for recursive features

### Learning Resources

- POSIX Shell specification
- Bash source code for implementation details
- "The Linux Programming Interface" for process management
- "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" for system calls
