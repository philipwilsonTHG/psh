## Remaining Features

### High Priority

#### Associative Arrays - **NEXT PRIORITY**
- **Description**: Support for bash associative arrays (declare -A)
- **Status**: Storage infrastructure exists (AssociativeArray class), parser updates needed
- **Remaining work**:
  - Parser support for associative array syntax: `arr[key]=value`
  - Key-based expansions: `${arr[key]}`, `${!arr[@]}` for keys
  - Integration with declare -A flag
  - String keys vs numeric indices differentiation
- **Note**: Infrastructure from v0.40.0 supports this, needs syntax parsing

#### Trap Command
- **Description**: Signal handling for cleanup and error management
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Use cases**: Cleanup on exit, error handling, signal interception


### Medium Priority


### Low Priority

#### Interactive Enhancements
- Tab completion for commands (beyond files/directories)
- Programmable completion framework
- Syntax highlighting in prompt
- Custom prompt variables (PS4)

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues

#### Deep Recursion Limitation
- **Problem**: Recursive functions with command substitution hit Python's recursion limit
- **Example**: `factorial(5)` using `$(factorial $((n-1)))` fails
- **Impact**: Limits recursive algorithm implementation
- **Workaround**: Use iterative algorithms
- **Documentation**: See `docs/recursion_depth_analysis.md`

### Recently Resolved Issues

PSH has resolved all major parser and tokenizer limitations as of v0.38.3:

#### ✅ **Composite Argument Quote Handling in Redirection** (Fixed in v0.38.2)
- Commands like `echo test > file'name'.txt` now correctly create `filename.txt`
- Test: `pytest tests/comparison/test_todo_documented_limitations.py -k redirection`

#### ✅ **Backslash Escaping** (Fixed in v0.38.3)  
- Commands like `echo \$variable` now correctly output `$variable` instead of expanding
- Test: `pytest tests/comparison/test_todo_documented_limitations.py -k backslash`

#### ✅ **Quote Handling in Words** (Working)
- Quote concatenation like `a'b'c` works correctly despite internal tokenizer behavior
- All bash comparison tests pass (56/56)

### Other Issues

## Test Suite Status

### Overall: 929 tests passing
### Skipped Tests: 26 total (down from 28 - fixed 2 in v0.33.0)

#### Pytest Output Capture Issues (8 tests)
- **Pipeline tests**: Builtins in pipelines don't work with pytest's output capture
- **Workaround**: Tests pass with `pytest -s` or manual execution
- **Not PSH bugs**: These are pytest infrastructure limitations

#### Can Be Fixed (10 tests)
- **CI-only failures** (3): Work locally, fail on GitHub Actions
- **Minor fixes needed** (5): Known issues with straightforward solutions
- **Test rewrite needed** (2): Can use file-based verification instead

#### Need Architectural Changes (8 tests)
- **Parser changes** (3): Break/continue operator handling  
- **Not implemented** (5): Escaped globs, arrays, PS1 history numbers

### Test Recommendations
1. Mark pipeline tests with custom pytest marker for clarity
2. Convert capture-based tests to file output verification
3. Document pytest limitations in affected test files

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles
1. **Component separation**: Each subsystem in its own module
2. **Educational clarity**: Code remains readable and teachable
3. **Test coverage**: Comprehensive tests for all features
4. **Error handling**: Clear messages with context

### Adding Features
1. Check dependencies and existing infrastructure
2. Design clean interfaces between components
3. Write tests before implementation
4. Update documentation (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)
5. Follow existing patterns and conventions
