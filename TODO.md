## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status Summary

### **Major Milestone: Complete Programming Language with Pattern Matching and Arithmetic (v0.18.0)**

psh has evolved from a basic educational shell into a **complete programming language** with full conditional logic, complete iteration capabilities, sophisticated loop control, and comprehensive pattern matching while maintaining its educational mission. Key achievements:

**Programming Language Capabilities:**
- âœ… Complete control structures: `if/then/else/fi`, `while/do/done`, `for/in/do/done`, `case/esac`
- âœ… Sophisticated pattern matching: wildcards (*), character classes ([abc], [a-z]), single character (?)
- âœ… Advanced case control: multiple patterns (a|b|c), fallthrough (;;, ;&, ;;&), default patterns (*)
- âœ… Loop control: `break` and `continue` statements for early termination and iteration skipping
- âœ… Comprehensive test operators: 15+ file test operators, string, numeric conditions
- âœ… Complex condition support: `&&`, `||`, pipelines, command substitution
- âœ… Variable expansion and scoping: proper isolation in loops with glob pattern support
- âœ… Flexible iteration: simple lists, variables, glob patterns, quoted items
- âœ… Execute shell scripts: `psh script.sh arg1 arg2`
- âœ… Enhanced source builtin: `source helper.sh arg1 arg2`  
- âœ… Line continuation: `echo "line 1" \ "line 2"`
- âœ… Shebang support: `#!/bin/bash`, `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- âœ… Multi-interpreter execution with proper fallback
- âœ… Production-quality error handling and reporting
- âœ… Core POSIX commands: colon (:) null command and dot (.) source synonym
- âœ… Arithmetic expansion: $((...)) with full operator support, variables, and bash compatibility

**Development Quality:**
- âœ… 48 major features implemented and tested
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite with 145+ passing tests (114 new tests across control structures, iteration, loop control, pattern matching, and arithmetic)
- âœ… Robust architecture supporting complete control structure suite with pattern matching
- âœ… Educational clarity preserved throughout

**Next Phase Focus:**
C-style for loops `for ((i=0; i<10; i++))` will complete the iteration constructs, leveraging the newly implemented arithmetic expansion for initialization, condition testing, and increment operations.

- **ðŸ”µ Lower Priority**: 1 feature group (Interactive enhancements)

**Total Progress**: ~94% of planned shell features complete, with **complete arithmetic evaluation** enabling mathematical computations and paving the way for C-style for loops.

## ðŸš¨ Known Issues & Limitations

### Architectural Limitations
- ~~**Nested Control Structures**~~: âœ… FIXED in v0.19.0 - Control structures can now be nested to arbitrary depth with the new Statement-based architecture
- **Multi-line Input Parsing**: Complex multi-line commands with nested structures fail to parse correctly. Single-line equivalents work fine.
- **Pipeline Job Control Issues**: Some pipelines are incorrectly treated as background jobs instead of running in foreground.

### Tokenizer Issues (NEW - discovered during arithmetic expansion testing)
- **Arithmetic Expansion in Assignments**: The tokenizer incorrectly breaks `c=$((a + b))` into separate tokens because `read_word()` stops at `(`. This should tokenize as `WORD='c='` followed by `ARITH_EXPANSION='$((a + b))'`.
- **Stderr Redirection**: The tokenizer incorrectly tokenizes `>&2` as three separate tokens (`>`, `&`, `2`) instead of recognizing it as a redirect duplication operator. This causes parser failures with "Expected file name after redirection" errors.
- **Arithmetic Inside Quotes**: Arithmetic expansion inside double quotes (e.g., `echo "Result: $((2 + 2))"`) is not being expanded because `_expand_string_variables()` only handles variable expansion, not arithmetic expansion.

### Parser Edge Cases
- **Empty Commands**: Consecutive semicolons (`;;`, `;;;`) are not handled gracefully in command parsing (though they work correctly in case statements).
- **Complex Quoting**: Some edge cases with complex nested quoting and escaping may not parse correctly.
- **EOF Cascade Errors**: When early parsing fails (e.g., redirect errors), the parser continues looking for closing keywords (`fi`, `done`) but hits EOF, causing cascading "Expected FI/DONE, got EOF" errors.
- **Command Substitution in For Loops**: Command substitution like `$(seq 1 5)` is not properly parsed in for loop iterables. The parser expects DO after seeing COMMAND_SUB token, causing "Expected DO, got COMMAND_SUB" errors. This prevents constructs like `for i in $(seq 1 5); do ... done`.

### Workarounds in Use
- Tests use single-line command syntax to avoid multi-line parsing issues
- ~~Nested control structure tests are skipped with clear documentation~~ - No longer needed after v0.19.0
- Some pipeline tests are skipped due to job control issues
- Avoid stderr redirection (`>&2`) in scripts; use `2>&1` or file redirection instead
- Avoid arithmetic expansion inside quotes; use unquoted arithmetic or concatenation
- Use explicit lists in for loops instead of command substitution (e.g., `for i in 1 2 3` instead of `for i in $(seq 1 3)`)

### Future Improvements Needed
1. ~~**AST Architecture Redesign**~~: âœ… COMPLETED in v0.19.0 - Implemented Statement base class and StatementList with full nesting support
2. **Multi-line Parser Enhancement**: Improve newline and indentation handling
3. **Job Control Refinement**: Fix pipeline classification between foreground/background
4. **Tokenizer Fixes**:
   - Fix `read_word()` to handle arithmetic expansion that starts within a word
   - Add proper tokenization for redirect duplication operators (`>&`, `<&`)
   - Enhance `_expand_string_variables()` to also handle arithmetic expansion inside strings
5. **Parser Error Recovery**: Improve error handling to avoid cascade errors when early parsing fails
6. **For Loop Enhancement**: Update parse_for_statement() to accept COMMAND_SUB tokens in the iterable list, enabling `for i in $(command)` syntax
