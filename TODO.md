## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate Next Features (Recommended Order)

1. **Control Structures** - `if`/`then`/`else`/`fi` - Most impactful for shell scripting
2. **Arithmetic Expansion** - `$((...))` - Essential for loops and conditionals

### Architecture Considerations

#### Lessons from Script Execution Implementation
- Unified input processing improves consistency across execution modes
- Proper state management crucial for source builtin and nested execution
- Shebang support requires careful subprocess handling and error management
- Binary file detection needs multi-factor analysis for accuracy

#### For Control Structures (Next Major Feature)

- Need to handle multi-line parsing and block delimiters
- Consider separate parsing modes for complex constructs
- Exit status propagation through blocks is crucial

#### For Job Control (Already Implemented)
- âœ… Process group management working correctly
- âœ… Signal handling properly configured
- âœ… Job table and notification system complete

#### For Advanced Expansions (Future)
- Order of expansions matters (follow POSIX specification)
- Need careful quote handling during expansion phases
- Some expansions happen at different parsing stages

### Current Architecture Strengths

1. **Modular Design** - Clear separation between tokenizer, parser, executor
2. **Educational Clarity** - Code remains readable and teachable
3. **Robust Error Handling** - Comprehensive error messages with file:line info
4. **Unified Input System** - Consistent handling across interactive, script, and source modes
5. **Production Compatibility** - Full shebang support enables real-world usage

### Testing Strategy
