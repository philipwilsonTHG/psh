# Interactive Tests

These tests use `pexpect` to test PSH in an interactive terminal environment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pexpect module (`pip install pexpect`)
- Unix-like system (Linux, macOS, BSD)

## Known Issues

### Line Editor Escape Sequences
PSH's line editor doesn't properly handle ANSI escape sequences in pseudo-terminal (PTY) environments. This causes tests that rely on arrow keys, backspace, or other special keys to fail. These tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.skip`.

### Timing Sensitivity
Interactive tests can be sensitive to system load and timing. If tests fail intermittently:
1. Check system load
2. Try increasing timeouts in `spawn_psh()` methods
3. Add small delays after sending commands

### Terminal Environment
The tests expect a standard terminal environment. If running in unusual environments (CI, containers, etc.), you may need to:
1. Set `TERM=xterm` or similar
2. Ensure proper locale settings (UTF-8)
3. Check that Python can detect TTY properly

## Debugging Failed Tests

If a test fails:

1. Run the specific test with verbose output:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests_new/system/interactive/test_name.py::TestClass::test_method -xvs
   ```

2. Check the debug output added to test_echo_simple for clues

3. Use the debug helpers:
   ```python
   from debug_helpers import debug_spawn, debug_expect_failure
   ```

4. Run the test outside pytest:
   ```bash
   python tmp/debug_test_name.py
   ```

## Test Categories

- **test_basic_interactive.py** - Basic command execution without line editing
- **test_line_editing.py** - Line editor features (many skipped due to PTY issues)
- **test_simple_commands.py** - Additional command execution tests
- **test_basic_spawn.py** - Low-level PSH spawning tests
