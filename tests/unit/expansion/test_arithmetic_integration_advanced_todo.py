IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:

HIGH PRIORITY:
1. Parameter expansion with arithmetic in offset/length positions
   - ${var:$((expr)):$((expr))} syntax
   - Critical for advanced shell scripting

2. Brace expansion integration
   - {$((expr1)),$((expr2))} syntax
   - Range expansion {$((start))..$((end))}

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
3. Case pattern arithmetic evaluation
   - Dynamic pattern generation using arithmetic
   - Important for complex case statements

4. Advanced error recovery
   - Better error handling in nested contexts
   - Graceful degradation without parser corruption

LOW PRIORITY:
5. Process substitution integration
   - <(command) and >(command) with arithmetic
   - Less commonly used feature

6. Extreme nesting optimization
   - Performance improvements for very deep nesting
   - Stack overflow prevention

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Parameter expansion is the most critical missing piece
- Most command substitution integration already works well
- Array integration is excellent and comprehensive
- Control structure integration is solid
- Error handling is generally good but could be more robust in edge cases

TESTING STRATEGY:
- Keep these advanced tests as skip markers
- Gradually enable them as features are implemented
- Use them as acceptance criteria for new features
- Update expected behaviors as implementation evolves
