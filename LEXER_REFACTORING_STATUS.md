# Lexer Refactoring Status Summary

## Overview
The PSH lexer refactoring project has completed Phases 1-4, creating a modular, extensible architecture. Integration testing has revealed compatibility issues that need to be addressed before the new lexer can replace the original.

## Completed Components

### Phase 1: Unified State Management âœ…
- `LexerContext` - Unified state representation
- `StateManager` - State transition management
- `EnhancedStateMachineLexer` - Lexer using unified state
- 18 tests, all passing

### Phase 2: Pure Function Helpers âœ…
- `pure_helpers.py` - 15+ stateless helper functions
- `EnhancedLexerHelpers` - Wrapper maintaining API compatibility
- 55 tests, all passing

### Phase 3: Unified Parsing âœ…
- `UnifiedQuoteParser` - Configurable quote parsing
- `ExpansionParser` - All expansion types
- `UnifiedLexer` - Integration of unified parsers
- 34 tests, all passing

### Phase 4: Token Recognition âœ…
- `TokenRecognizer` - Abstract interface
- 5 specialized recognizers (operator, keyword, literal, whitespace, comment)
- `RecognizerRegistry` - Priority-based dispatch
- `ModularLexer` - Full integration
- 29 tests, all passing

## Integration Status ðŸš§

### Configuration
- Added `PSH_USE_MODULAR_LEXER` environment variable to `psh/lexer/__init__.py`
- Allows switching between old and new lexer implementations

### Compatibility Issues Found
1. **Context tracking**: `]]` not recognized correctly inside `[[ ]]`
2. **Variable expansion**: `$` prefix lost in double quotes
3. **Token granularity**: Different tokenization of `text$VAR`
4. **Keyword recognition**: `in` not recognized in for loops
5. **Escape sequences**: Different handling of backslashes
6. **Error handling**: Different behavior for unclosed quotes

### Files Created
- `LEXER_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed integration strategy
- `LEXER_COMPATIBILITY_ISSUES.md` - Specific issues to fix
- `tests/test_lexer_compatibility.py` - Comprehensive comparison tests

## Decision: Defer Phases 5-6

### Rationale
- Focus on integrating and stabilizing existing work
- Validate architecture in production before adding complexity
- Address compatibility issues first
- Gather real-world feedback

### Deferred Phases
- **Phase 5**: Error Recovery Framework
- **Phase 6**: Scanner-based Implementation
- **Phase 7**: Configuration and Validation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Fix Compatibility)
1. Fix context tracking in ModularLexer
2. Preserve `$` in variable expansions
3. Handle composite tokens correctly
4. Fix keyword recognition context

### Short Term (Complete Integration)
1. Run full test suite with ModularLexer
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Gradual rollout with monitoring

### Long Term (After Integration)
1. Remove old lexer implementation
2. Consider implementing deferred phases
3. Optimize based on production experience

## Summary
The lexer refactoring has created a solid architectural foundation with 136+ tests. While not yet ready for production due to compatibility issues, the modular design provides clear extension points and improved maintainability. The decision to pause further refactoring and focus on integration is prudent and follows best practices for incremental improvement.
