## Architecture

PSH follows a modern component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components
- **Shell** (`psh/shell.py`): Main orchestrator coordinating all subsystems
- **Lexer** (`psh/lexer/`): Modular tokenization with mixin architecture
- **Parser** (`psh/parser/`): Dual parser implementation:
  - **Recursive Descent** (`recursive_descent/`): Production parser with modular package structure
  - **Parser Combinator** (`combinators/`): Functional parsing with 100% feature parity
- **Executor** (`psh/executor/`): Command execution with specialized handlers
- **Expansion** (`psh/expansion/`): All shell expansions with proper precedence
- **I/O Management** (`psh/io_redirect/`): File operations and redirection handling
- **Interactive** (`psh/interactive/`): REPL, completion, history, and prompts

### Visitor Pattern Integration
PSH implements the visitor pattern for AST operations, enabling:
- **Analysis Tools**: Metrics, security scanning, linting
- **Code Transformation**: Formatting, optimization
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new analysis features

### Dual Parser Implementation
PSH uniquely includes two complete parser implementations:
- **Recursive Descent Parser**: Production parser with modular package structure, clear error messages, and comprehensive shell support
- **Parser Combinator**: Functional parsing implementation demonstrating elegant composition and achieving 100% feature parity
- **Educational Value**: Compare and contrast imperative vs. functional parsing approaches
- **Parser Selection**: Use `parser-select combinator` builtin to switch between implementations
- **Feature Parity**: Both parsers support all shell constructs (control structures, arrays, process substitution, etc.)

### Project Statistics
- **Lines of Code**: ~99,000 across 348 Python files
- **Test Coverage**: 3,087 tests in 166 test files
- **Architecture**: 8 major components with focused responsibilities
- **Visitors**: 9 analysis and transformation visitors
- **Dual Parser**: Both recursive descent and parser combinator implementations

## Testing & Quality

Canonical testing commands for contributors and CI are maintained in
`docs/testing_source_of_truth.md`.

### Running Tests (Recommended)

Use the provided test runner for correct handling of all tests:

```bash
# Smart mode (recommended) - handles subshell tests correctly
python run_tests.py
# or
./run_tests.sh

# Quick mode - skip slow tests
python run_tests.py --quick

# All tests with capture disabled (simpler but noisy)
python run_tests.py --all-nocapture
```

### Running Tests Manually

```bash
# Most tests - run normally
python -m pytest tests/

# Subshell tests - MUST use -s flag
python -m pytest tests/integration/subshells/ -s

# Specific categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/           # Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/    # Integration tests
python -m pytest tests/conformance/    # POSIX/bash compatibility

# Performance tests
python -m pytest tests/performance/

# Coverage reporting
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=psh --cov-report=html
```

**Important:** Some tests (subshells, functions with subshells) require pytest's output capture to be disabled (`-s` flag) due to file descriptor handling in forked processes. The `run_tests.py` script handles this automatically.

**Current Test Statistics:**
- ✅ 2,808 passing tests
- ⏭️ 173 skipped tests (platform-specific or interactive)
- ⚠️ 36 xfailed (expected failures for unimplemented features)
- 📊 High coverage across all components

## POSIX Compliance

PSH achieves approximately **98% POSIX compliance** and **92% bash compatibility**:

### Compliance Highlights
- ✅ **Shell Grammar**: 98% - All major constructs supported
- ✅ **Parameter Expansion**: 95% - All standard forms implemented
- ✅ **I/O Redirection**: 95% - Complete standard redirection support
- ✅ **Control Structures**: 100% - Full if/while/for/case support
- ✅ **Built-in Commands**: 95% - Most essential commands implemented

### Bash Compatibility
PSH includes many bash extensions while maintaining POSIX compliance:
- Associative arrays with `declare -A`
- Enhanced test operators `[[ ]]` with regex support
- Brace expansion and process substitution
- Advanced parameter expansion with string manipulation
- C-style for loops and arithmetic commands
- Extended globbing (`shopt -s extglob`) with `?()`, `*()`, `+()`, `@()`, `!()` operators

## Known Limitations

While PSH implements most shell features, some limitations remain:

- **Signal Handling**: `trap` builtin not yet implemented
- **Deep Recursion**: Recursive functions hit Python stack limits
- **Some Advanced Features**: Minor gaps in specialized POSIX utilities

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for planned enhancements.

## Educational Value

PSH serves as an excellent learning resource for:
- **Shell Implementation**: Understanding lexing, parsing, and execution
- **Parsing Techniques**: Compare recursive descent vs. functional parser combinator approaches
- **Language Design**: Seeing how shell features interact and compose
- **System Programming**: Learning process management and I/O redirection
- **Software Architecture**: Studying component-based design patterns
- **Functional Programming**: Parser combinators demonstrate functional composition in real-world parsing

The codebase prioritizes clarity and includes extensive documentation to support learning shell internals and language implementation techniques. The dual parser implementation provides a unique opportunity to see the same language parsed using both imperative and functional approaches.
